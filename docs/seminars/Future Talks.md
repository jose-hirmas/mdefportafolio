# Future Talks

### Talk 1: Audrey Desjardins

I was inspired by the way design interventions are part of daily life (in a first person perspective). Most of the time, the designer uses their own systems to learn (autobiographical design). I got commited with some tips: check in with yourself (how are you?), set a timeframe, document your work and be ready to communicate, change your role, find people that share your purpose, use our body as research tools.
