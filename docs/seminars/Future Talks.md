# Future Talks

### Talk 1: Audrey Desjardins

I was inspired by the way design interventions are part of daily life (in a first person perspective). Most of the time, the designer uses their own systems to learn (autobiographical design). I got commited with some tips: check in with yourself (how are you?), set a timeframe, document your work and be ready to communicate, change your role, find people that share your purpose, use our body as research tools. 

### Talk 2: Laura Forlano

I was inspired by the autoethnographic experience in design, "you can see the yourself in the world and the world in you" and describing herself as a disabled ciborg. The use of the "what if" for triggering questions and ideas that rapidly are transformed into action. Collecting data of your own life can be meaningfull. We can collaborate with no-humans technology, algorythms, nature, and other) There is no limit between designer and 'whom you design for'.
