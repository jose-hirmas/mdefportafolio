# Future Talks

### Talk 1: Audrey Desjardins

- I was inspired by the way design interventions are part of daily life (in a first person perspective). 
- Most of the time, the designer uses their own systems to learn (autobiographical design). 
- I got commited with some tips: check in with yourself (how are you?), set a timeframe, document your work and be ready to communicate, change your role, find people that share your purpose, use our body as research tools. 

### Talk 2: Laura Forlano

- I was inspired by the autoethnographic experience in design, "you can see the yourself in the world and the world in you" and describing herself as a disabled ciborg. 
- The use of the "what if" for triggering questions and ideas that rapidly are transformed into action. 
- Collecting data of your own life can be meaningfull. 
- We can collaborate with no-humans technology, algorythms, nature, and other).
- There is no limit between designer and 'whom you design for'.

### Talk 3: Sergio Urue√±a 

- I was inspired by responsible innovation and by asking myself "what being responsible means?". 
- The circular approach of understanding how society and technology are mutually shaping reality, make me realize the importance of "taking care of the future" and also how "things have agency". 
- Everything is affected and affects (enacted by and for) everything in a way. 
- Taking in consideration the 4 dimensions (inclusion, reflexivity, responsiveness and anticipation) is a frame for developing projects for the future.
