# Exploring Emergent Technologies (in process)

> ## 

## Remixing Materials 

### Exploration

During this seminar we were introduced to biomaterials and had the opportunity of experimenting using different food waste. For this, I decided to collect food waste of my daily use: coffee grounds and tangerine peel.

In groups we did experimentation of biomaterial recipes:

### Gelatine

- 20gr gelatine
- 250ml water
- 15gr glycerin
- 2ml vinegar
- 30gr aditives

### Pine Resine

- 45gr pine resine
- 15ml alcohol
- 5gr carnauba wax
- 40/60gr food waste

### Other biomaterial experimientation

It was the first time I experiment with these type of biomaterials and I was impressed by how the process is determined by handcrafting, in a way very similar to cooking food. Each ingredient amount, the heating temperature, the mixing order of each ingredient are significant things for the final result. For this reason, every small change affects the outcome. 

In the material scarcity moment that we are facing as humanity, it is necesarry to keep on looking for alternatives that can be sustainable, being aware of their properties and potential use. The biomaterial production is highly determined by the local waste, making difficult to transform this alternatives in industrial production without harming the environment. For example: in Spanish coasts there is abundant Agar Agar or in Chilean coasts there is abundant sea shell, so each local biomaterials experimentation should use mainly this type of wastes. 

It is interesting to think the design of new products limited by the use of local biomaterials. This could open new insights for product outcomes and new innovation design opportunities. What if each product was determined by the excess of materials that are available in the near sorroundings?How many alternatives for the same final product can we imagine?
