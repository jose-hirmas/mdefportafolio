# Extended Inteligences (NO LISTO)

> ## "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change" 


During these weeks we started exploring artificial intelligence by introducing some new concepts such as: machine learning, neural network and data sets. 


We used




![](../images/week9/neuralnet.jpg)
This was an exercise with an image generator net, where each one collect 100 pictures of the Poblenou neighbourhood and the last 100 pictures of the phone. For me it was interesting to understand that we decide: what we want to do, the data set we use and the network we use, but we donÂ´t decide how the net autoconfigures itself (concept of blackbox)




### Neural Networks: Universal Declaration of Ants Rights

Human beings are not the center of the world. All animals that exist, including small insects, should have rights. So, we created a document that refers to all the rights that ants have.

We are using GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), a third-generation language prediction model by Open AI.

You can see the result in here: **<https://antrights.com/>**
