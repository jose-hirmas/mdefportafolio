# Future Talks

### Talk 1: Audrey Desjardins

- I was inspired by the way design interventions are part of daily life (in a first person perspective). 
- Most of the time, the designer uses their own systems to learn (autobiographical design). 
- I got commited with some tips: check in with yourself (how are you?), set a timeframe, document your work and be ready to communicate, change your role, find people that share your purpose, use our body as research tools. 

### Talk 2: Laura Forlano

- I was inspired by the autoethnographic experience in design, "you can see the yourself in the world and the world in you" and describing herself as a disabled ciborg. 
- The use of the "what if" for triggering questions and ideas that rapidly are transformed into action. 
- Collecting data of your own life can be meaningfull. 
- We can collaborate with no-humans technology, algorythms, nature, and other).
- There is no limit between designer and 'whom you design for'.

### Talk 3: Sergio Urueña 

- I was inspired by responsible innovation and by asking myself "what being responsible means?". 
- The circular approach of understanding how society and technology are mutually shaping reality, make me realize the importance of "taking care of the future" and also how "things have agency". 
- Everything is affected and affects (enacted by and for) everything in a way. 
- Taking in consideration the 4 dimensions (inclusion, reflexivity, responsiveness and anticipation) is a frame for developing projects for the future. 


### Talk 4: Saul Baeza

- I was inspired by the concept of radical design and going further on our own boundaries. This radicality happens always in a context, so what is radical for me is different than from anybody else. Sometimes to go further, means to go back to the roots (to the basis).
- The exploration is a thing in itself, do not expect a specific outcome.
- Good examples of how our body is a tool for exploring and understanding life, society and the world.

### Talk 4: Ron Wakkary

- I was inspired by the idea of the gathering of humans and non humans for the intention of designing something. 
- In "design with" concept, we are all interconected (relationality) and things have their own agency.
- How do we co-habit this more than human world? Biographies are made of different biographies. There is a "speaken subject" that narrates it.
- When will a biography end?, and what is left behind?


#### Final Reflection

*Who you are?*

I am a human being. I am son, grandson, brother, uncle, friend, husband. I am strongly attached to my emotions and aware of what is happening around me. I get inspired by people. I need social interaction to grow, to change, to live. 

It is difficult to define myself, so it is easy to say that I feel like a multidisciplinary professional: study commercial engineering as undergraduate, study acting and theater, specialize in innovation methodologies, teach in different educational contexts, cofounded a B corp that works with communities, and now expanding my career through design and technology for emergent futures. I have never like tags or job titles but know it is to simplify reality and who we are or what we do. For me it would be: Social entrepreneur, business designer & educator. Interested in design as a tool for social transformation and the generation of positive impact for the future(s).

I am passionate about fabrication process (the doing), art as a social agent of expression and food culture.

*What makes you unique (identity)?*

The way I built relationships with people.

*Personal “vision” of your future as a professional*

Design Researcher and Social Doer. I want to feel as a permanent learner, exploring new things beyond boundaries, constructing alternative presents and imagining emergent futures. I want to continue my radical design journey as a trigger for generating awareness about critical scenarios. I want to continue discovering things, but not in only in a theoretical form but with my feet in the street. Doing what is needed, always with a social sense.

I feel responsible for what is happening and also I feel I have the power to make a positive change.
