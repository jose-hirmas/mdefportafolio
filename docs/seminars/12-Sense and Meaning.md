# Sense and Meaning


## Abstract

What is a wave? My definition: a wave is the relationship between a specific amount of wind, a portion of the sea, and the location of the moon. In a way, these three things are aligned in a unique form that create what we humans call “wave”. What about other agents we are not aware of that affect the fabrication of this wave? How we find these invisible relations that make the reality possible?

To Design means to understand the relationship between humans and non- humans. In this matter, relationality is fundamental when describing the being. Exploring the interconnection between everyone and everything, and discovering hidden forces of ecology can be a trigger for shifting our role in the world. When I say “things” I mean “everything and everyone that exists”. Things do not exist without other things around. When changing this context where things emerge, new things appear. This is attached to the biography of each thing. Each biography is a story, and each story has a unique meaning due to a context. A thing is always an interconnected being, we see it or not. When this specific interconnection occurs, reality is created.

Senses are the human tools for creating and understanding reality. Each thing (interconnection in a context) is also a message. Messages construct narratives, and these narratives are usually curated by humans thanks to communication. The way we communicate in a traditional present or to “have voice” is primary human centered, and the reality is created from this empowered point of view.

What if we give voice to agents that usually do not have it? How to understand life, the world and reality from a “no voice” point of view? An interconnected being has a specific form of message which allows its existence. Redefining the communication concept plays a significant role as a tool for revealing new narratives and by consequence in creating alternative realities. This process can be driven for emergent outcomes. Radical doing is the main characteristic when constructing something that we do not imagine. We do not base in theoretic parameters because that builds walls that are difficult to break. We do not design for someone specific, because we need to allow participation in any form, so the unexpected can appear.

This paper explores the role of communication for existence, the emergent relationships between humans and non-humans and the boundaries of the message and the messenger for the appearance of a new being. Design can save the world, with empathy as a core value for relationships that go beyond any imagined scenario. Exploring these hidden relationships and finally revealing that reality has always meant to be a specific form of ordering things in a context, is a must for emergent futures. Design for no one and for nobody, do not take relationships for granted and be brave in rethinking things by changing context, because everything and everyone have something to say, to participate and to be.
