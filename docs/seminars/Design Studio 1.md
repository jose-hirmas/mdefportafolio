**Design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future:**

My vision is to generate spaces for human relations and their educational and social development, empowering in the need of being part of something, accepting each others realities, empathizing, sharing and creating community as a main concept.

**Personal Development Plan**

**My New Me**

To construct my design and creativity attitude I got really inspired by NasaÂ´s I.S.R.U (In Situ Resource Utilization) and I am applying some methods that artist Tom Sachs defined as part of his creative way: output first thing in the morning, do what you love, setup is everything, start easy, patience, forgive yourself of perfectionism, make to do lists.
