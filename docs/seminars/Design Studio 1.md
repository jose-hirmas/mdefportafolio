**My New Me**

To construct my design and creativity attitude I got really inspired by NasaÂ´s I.S.R.U (In Situ Resource Utilization) and applying some methods that artist Tom Sachs defined as part of his creative way: output first thing in the morning, do what you love, setup is everything, start easy, patience, forgive yourself of perfectionism, make to do lists.
