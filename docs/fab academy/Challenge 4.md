# Challenge 4

## Integrated prototype that helps your MDEF Project and integrates the range of units covered.

My research has focused on seeking new ways of building relationships and ‘giving voice to agents that usually do not have it’, generating awareness about critical scenarios that affect society. My work includes food culture, art, craftsmanship, migration, generating learning and sharing environments as a source of inspiration for new narratives that can impact education and social development.

Social Food Narratives is a research project that gives a new role to food, exploring the meaning behind it, for understanding culture, regenerating communities, and seeking human relationships with the world.

- Exploring food culture for understanding human relationships
- Creating new ways of bonding with and through food.
- Redefining the role of food for the future(s)


### **Bottling Identities** 

The main concept is about an inteligent machine/software that can identify people´s culture and emotions, transforming it into a unique beer recipe.

*What if we could embodied ourselves in another thing?* 

The proposal for this project is to explore the possibility of transforming a person´s identity into a specific type of beer.

Using machine learning we could program a software that allows us to categorize people´s identities into different topics such as: emotions, skills, attitudes, culture, among others. With sensors we could detect and allign different movements and sounds, getting information from the exterior and transforming it into a numeric value. Each value would have a different meaning according to the previous classification we gave to identities.

For the beer final output, the research includes understanding the crafting process and selecting the the exact mix and amount of ingredients that make the beer unique an special, according to each identity.
