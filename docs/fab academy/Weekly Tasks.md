# Weekly Tasks and Reflections

## W1 - Principles and practices, project management

During the MDEF, my documentation has been made using git and some basics of html, which was a big challenge. 

The first class of Fab Academy started with a refresh with basic internet definitions and the distributed version control system (DVCS) concept. 

I researched the webpages from last year and got interested in 3 examples of documentation :

1. Separating the week into facts, feelings, findings and future (Ines Burdiles). I am interested in the relationship between emotions and the process of fabrication, and this method is an excercise for self awareness. Also, the important of putting goals for the future. 
**<https://ines_burdiles.gitlab.io/sitio/single-fabweek1.html>** 

2. Initial questions and final questions (Morgane Sha’ban). The power of doing questions as a tool for triggering actions, awakening different interests and embodying design and technology interventions. 
**<https://morgane_shaban.gitlab.io/mdef/reflectionFA01.html>**

3. Telling a story (Roger Guillemany). I think showing the work as part of "your story" makes the reader involve and feel empathy with the process of the designer, constructing a unique identity to the documentation.

I was excited by Neil Gershenfeld's global class with more tan 300 students around the world. 

## W2 - Computer aided design (CAD)

This second week was about 2D and 3D modelling, understanding basic distinctions about CAD: vector vs ruster, mesh vs nurbs.I started exploring different softwares such as Gimp, Inkscape, Fusion 360, Rhino, Blender ( all new to me) and learn a lot with some online tutorials, finally chosing Fusion 360 as a 3D modelling tool because I think it is much easy to learn (it is the first time I use this type of tools), it has all the features I need right now, and I have the free educational license. "Fusion 360 is a cloud-based 3D modeling, CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB software platform for product design and manufacturing".

- Parametric design: " the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures"

- Generative design: "design the system that designs"

### Cerveza hecha a mano

During the last weeks I have been exploring with craft beer making.

This was my first 3D model (of a bottle):

## W3 - Computer control cutting (CCC)

This week was about computer control cutter and I have the opportuniy to use the laser cutting machine. For the task of this week, we design some special figures that are part of a game we are developing. One of the main challenges was prototyping the game and learning about how to fix the size of the holes of each figure where the rope passes, by using sand paper and do it all by hand.

## W4 - Electronics production

During this week we were introduced to PCB (printed circuit board) and its fabrication process. I learned how soldering the smd components with a practical workshop.

The act of soldering was a concentration exercise, paying attention to things that we usually take for granted: breathing, pulse and focus. Being aware of how this affects the final result make me see and feel this workshop as a self awareness therapy. In a way, I felt relaxed and enjoying the process itself.
 

## W5 - 3D printing and scanning

During this week we where introduced to 3d printing. I got inspired by the evolution of this and how is shifting the relationship between humans and the design and fabrication of things. I have never used the 3D printer and I find it very intuitive and fun experience.

For this task I decided to print a oval shape and spheres that could help me understand how the printer works and the different tecniques that are involved in the process of printing.

## W6 - Electronics design

This week was about electronics, focusing in PCBs design, understanding the use of each component and a introduction to EDA softwares (electronic computer aided design). 

For this task I decided to start following a tutorial to learn the step by step of designing my first PCB, using Fritzing.

The first time using fritizing:

## W7 - Computer controlled machining 

We used this task to work as a team developing the project "Biography of Dead Ideas", that was exhibited during Design Dialogues 2. 

For this, we designed a round surface were "all the objects that talk" would stand. This was cut using the CNC machine.

## W8 - Embedded programming

This week was an introduction to embedded programming. I used this task for programming a circuit that transforms the touching sensors (input) into sounds (output). This was used in the project "Sensing Decisions", that we developed for micro challenge 3. The HUZZAH32, ESP32 Feather has touching inputs incorporated, so it was ver intuitive for the making  the code to work.

## W9 - Molding and casting

This week I used to task to continue my project about food design, helping me understand more about the alternative present I am generating: Social Food Narratives. For the mold I design a 3d print of an avocado. For the cast I experiment with a potato puree mix.

## W10&13 - Input and outputs 
pending

## W11
Nothing. This is machine week, we did "the almost useless machines".

## W12
No task for this week.

## W14 - Networking and communications
pending

## W15 - Interface and application programming

This week we learned about resources and platforms that are used for building interfaces and programming. I got special attention in P5.js, because is very intuitive and accesible for designers and artists. Also i like the open code and free access. For this task I am trying to build a "shooter game", using a youtube tutorial to understand the programming and step by step.

## W17 - Applications and implications

During the Master in Design for Emergent Futures, my research has focused on seeking new ways of building relationships and ‘giving voice to agents that usually do not have it’, generating awareness about critical scenarios that affect society. My work includes food culture, art, craftsmanship, migration, generating learning and sharing environments as a source of inspiration for new narratives that can impact education and social development.

The alternative present that has emerged is: SOCIAL FOOD NARRATIVES

What is it?

Social Food Narratives is a research project that gives a new role to food, exploring the meaning behind it, for understanding culture, regenerating communities, and seeking human relationships with the world.

- Exploring food culture for understanding human relationships
- Creating new ways of bonding with and through food.
- Redefining the role of food for the future(s)

My final MDEF intervention is : Uan Bier Plis, stories behind brewing.
This celebrates diverse contexts, people, and cultures around beer brewing, generating awareness about this ancient and present beverage, and seeking new meanings for the futures. Interviews are made to different breweries, master brewers and people related to beer culture around the world.

For this a workshop and an exhibition is done with the collaboration of LEKA. 

**Interviews**

A series of interviews to different master brewers, brewery owners and people related to craft beer. Each interview is conducted by video call or in person depending on the location.

The questions that guide each interview are: - Present yourself. (Who are you?) - Tell the story about this brewery. How and why was born? - What does this beer(s) represent? - If you could make a beer that represents the world right now, how would it be? - What is beer going to mean in the future?

In the last weeks I have contacted more than 20 craft breweries around the world and the interviews are in process.

One specific interview that was special for me was with Canaan Khoury, from Taybeh Bewing Company. This is the only brewery from Palestine. We talked about immigration, challenges of a country that has been in constant war, lifestyle and the future of beer and society. It was meaningful because my ancestors are from Palestine and came to Chile looking for opportunities, so I felt emotional and empathize with the stories behind brewing.

As the interviews are getting done, I am getting fascinated by the stories, different people, and culture, so the next step is to prepare a mini documentary that can show “the stories behind brewing”.

**Exhibition (part of MDEF Fest)**

What: Explore different beer cultures and history of beer.

How: Interviews to different breweries and beer master’s around the world. A canvas will be displayed telling the history and example of techniques and styles. Also, there will be a display of bottles made by workshop participants.

**Workshop (part of MDEF Fest)**

What Construct our personal identities connecting ingredients and raw materials with emotions, interests, and culture.

How Each participant will have the opportunity to choose ingredients and raw materials that represent themselves, putting them together into a bottle or “bottling the identity”. These bottles will be displayed in the event. We will share some experimental beers (with fermented fruits and other), sharing our stories.

Choose the ingredients and fill the bottles (10 min)
Share each story (30 min)
Try experimental beers with ingredients.
Respond: What will the beer mean in the future? (5 min)
Fermentation (collaboration with LEKA)

As part of my project and generation of communities, I have the opportunity to start co-working with Ivan and Arleny from Leka Restaurant. In this case, we are fermenting different fruits and vegetables using alternative techniques. This fermented results are planned to be part of the beer tasting experience, where we are going to mix them with “dead beer” to experiment new flavors and aromas.


## W18 - Invention, intellectual property and income

The plan for continuing this project is:
- continue interviews 
- develop a documentary that shows the different cultures about beer. 
- keep on nourishing my community

I believe in open source, so will be very proud to share the documentary with the community.
