# Weekly Tasks and Reflections

## Week 1 - Principles and practices, project management

During the MDEF, my documentation has been made using git and some basics of html, which was a big challenge. 

The first class of Fab Academy started with a refresh with basic internet definitions and the distributed version control system (DVCS) concept. 

I researched the webpages from last year and got interested in 3 examples of documentation :

1. Separating the week into facts, feelings, findings and future (Ines Burdiles). I am interested in the relationship between emotions and the process of fabrication, and this method is an excercise for self awareness. Also, the important of putting goals for the future.

2. Initial questions and final questions (Morgane Shaâ€™ban). The power of doing questions as a tool for triggering actions, awakening different interests and embodying design and technology interventions.

3. Telling a story (Roger Guillemany). I think showing the work as part of "your story" makes the reader involve and feel empathy with the process of the designer, constructing a unique identity to the documentation.

I was excited by Neil Gershenfeld's global class with more tan 300 students around the world.
