# Weekly Tasks and Reflections

## W1 - Principles and Practices, Project management

During the MDEF, my documentation has been made using git and some basics of html, which was a big challenge. 

The first class of Fab Academy started with a refresh with basic internet definitions and the distributed version control system (DVCS) concept. 

I researched the webpages from last year and got interested in 3 examples of documentation :

1. Separating the week into facts, feelings, findings and future (Ines Burdiles). I am interested in the relationship between emotions and the process of fabrication, and this method is an excercise for self awareness. Also, the important of putting goals for the future.

2. Initial questions and final questions (Morgane Shaâ€™ban). The power of doing questions as a tool for triggering actions, awakening different interests and embodying design and technology interventions.

3. Telling a story (Roger Guillemany). I think showing the work as part of "your story" makes the reader involve and feel empathy with the process of the designer, constructing a unique identity to the documentation.

I was excited by Neil Gershenfeld's global class with more tan 300 students around the world. 

## W2 - Computer Aided Design (CAD)

This second week was about 2D and 3D modelling, understanding basic distinctions about CAD: vector vs ruster, mesh vs nurbs.I started exploring different softwares such as Gimp, Inkscape, Fusion 360, Rhino, Blender ( all new to me) and learn a lot with some online tutorials, finally chosing Fusion 360 as a 3D modelling tool because I think it is much easy to learn (it is the first time I use this type of tools), it has all the features I need right now, and I have the free educational license. "Fusion 360 is a cloud-based 3D modeling, CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB software platform for product design and manufacturing".

- Parametric design: " the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures"

- Generative design: "design the system that designs"

### Cerveza hecha a mano

During the last weeks I have been exploring with craft beer making.

This was my first 3D model (of a bottle):

This is the renderized model:

I took some pictures when making some beer and make this simple poster:

## W3 - Computer Control Cutting (CCC) (pending)

## W4 - Electronics production

During this week we were introduced to PCB (printed circuit board) and its fabrication process. I learned how soldering the smd components with a practical workshop.
