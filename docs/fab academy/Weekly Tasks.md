# Weekly Tasks and Reflections

## W1 - Principles and practices, project management

During the MDEF, my documentation has been made using git and some basics of html, which was a big challenge. 

The first class of Fab Academy started with a refresh with basic internet definitions and the distributed version control system (DVCS) concept. 

I researched the webpages from last year and got interested in 3 examples of documentation :

1. Separating the week into facts, feelings, findings and future (Ines Burdiles). I am interested in the relationship between emotions and the process of fabrication, and this method is an excercise for self awareness. Also, the important of putting goals for the future.

2. Initial questions and final questions (Morgane Shaâ€™ban). The power of doing questions as a tool for triggering actions, awakening different interests and embodying design and technology interventions.

3. Telling a story (Roger Guillemany). I think showing the work as part of "your story" makes the reader involve and feel empathy with the process of the designer, constructing a unique identity to the documentation.

I was excited by Neil Gershenfeld's global class with more tan 300 students around the world. 

## W2 - Computer aided design (CAD)

This second week was about 2D and 3D modelling, understanding basic distinctions about CAD: vector vs ruster, mesh vs nurbs.I started exploring different softwares such as Gimp, Inkscape, Fusion 360, Rhino, Blender ( all new to me) and learn a lot with some online tutorials, finally chosing Fusion 360 as a 3D modelling tool because I think it is much easy to learn (it is the first time I use this type of tools), it has all the features I need right now, and I have the free educational license. "Fusion 360 is a cloud-based 3D modeling, CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB software platform for product design and manufacturing".

- Parametric design: " the relationship between elements is used to manipulate and inform the design of complex geometries and structures"

- Generative design: "design the system that designs"

### Cerveza hecha a mano

During the last weeks I have been exploring with craft beer making.

This was my first 3D model (of a bottle):

This is the renderized model:

I took some pictures when making some beer and make this simple poster:

## W3 - Computer control cutting (CCC)

This week was about computer control cutter and I have the opportuniy to use the laser cutting machine. For the task of this week, we design some special figures that are part of a game we are developing. One of the main challenges was prototyping the game and learning about how to fix the size of the holes of each figure where the rope passes, by using sand paper and do it all by hand.

## W4 - Electronics production

During this week we were introduced to PCB (printed circuit board) and its fabrication process. I learned how soldering the smd components with a practical workshop.

The act of soldering was a concentration exercise, paying attention to things that we usually take for granted: breathing, pulse and focus. Being aware of how this affects the final result make me see and feel this workshop as a self awareness therapy. In a way, I felt relaxed and enjoying the process itself.
 

## W5 - 3D printing and scanning

During this week we where introduced to 3d printing. I got inspired by the evolution of this and how is shifting the relationship between humans and the design and fabrication of things. I have never used the 3D printer and I find it very intuitive and fun experience.

For this task I decided to print a oval shape and spheres that could help me understand how the printer works and the different tecniques that are involved in the process of printing.

W6 - Electronics design

This week was about electronics, focusing in PCBs design, understanding the use of each component and a introduction to EDA softwares (electronic computer aided design). 



## W7 - Computer controlled machining 

We used this task to work as a team developing the project "Biography of Dead Ideas", that was exhibited during Design Dialogues 2. 

For this, we designed a round surface were "all the objects that talk" would stand. This was cut using the CNC machine.

## W8 - Embedded programming

This week was an introduction to embedded programming. I used this task for programming a circuit that transforms the touching sensors (input) into sounds (output). This was used in the project "Sensing Decisions", that we developed for micro challenge 3. The HUZZAH32, ESP32 Feather has touching inputs incorporated, so it was ver intuitive for the making  the code to work.

## W9 - Molding and casting

This week I used to task to continue my project about food design, helping me understand more about the alternative present I am generating: Social Food Narratives. For the mold I design a 3d print of an avocado. For the cast I experiment with a potato puree mix.
