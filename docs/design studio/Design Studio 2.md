# Design Studio 2

### My journey so far

More than 4 months have passed since my arrival to Barcelona and starting the MDEF, and many new lessons learned so far.

The **first person perspective** approach has been a new way of discovering the world, making me conscious about a new designer mindset. During my past professional career, I had been designing social projects for others with a traditional human centered approach, so now it is more evident to feel the intervention(s), redefining the concept of empathy and “putting on the other´s shoes”. This has been meaningful not only in the way I start understanding deeply what is happening around me, but also slowly transforming myself into a doer (a maker). Some examples of this were the “Positive foods” (cooking, eating and sharing), “Fabrication for Someone You Love” (designing, fabricating and using the fab lab tools) and “Aprendizaje Emocionante” (drawing, sharing and making conversation). At the same point, when “designing with” I am feeling more confident about my skills and attitudes, and more aware about my weaknesses and aspects to improve. 

So, I will continue doing. Going out of my head and putting the energy in my hands.

My mind has been full of ideas, and I have been always reflecting and over thinking things, which has been over time conflicted in my decision making. Trying **not having preconcibed ideas**, staying in the flow of what is happening right now, listening to others (and trying to talk less) with a humble attitude, and working in different groups (with different backgrounds) it has been a powerful choice. Instead of trying to control what is going to happen, I am open to uncertainty, and new opportunities and never imagined futures are suddenly appearing.  This is important for me and is slowing my way of living and anxiety towards the future.

It is not only about living in the present, but also having the ability of getting from each experience what is meaningful. In this way, the **documentation process** has been an excellent complementary tool for taking my learnings to a next level of understanding and making me aware of what is important. Also, I can prioritize my thoughts and when communicating my work and journey to others, be clearer and feel connected.  This documentation and communication have helped me transforming words and concepts into realities. So, the more I talk about something, the more real is that “something”. In this matter, for having a more solid base I want to focus some energy also on research. 

My personal formula: 70% Act + 20% Reflect + 10% Research.

This master has been the **STARTING POINT OF SOMETHING**.

For me, design is not about a product outcome, but an exercise of interventions in a defined system that is in constantly movement. It is not about the final result, but a circular process (learning loops) where you go gaining feedback.

New project goals for this term:
- Trying new things. You dont't know until you know.
- Keep understanding where I am standing right now.
- Don't forget my own skills and attitudes.
- Connect what is important for me, with what is important for others.
- Design a specific outcome (land my ideas and vision)

### My Interests and What is Happening
![](../images/designstudio/interestswih.jpg)

My main interests, which I had been driven and exploring, can be sintetize into:  
**emotions**, **fabrication process**, **alternative learning**.

In order to connect this topics I choose **Food** as the medium. I have a special relation with food, more than just nutrition or eating. During all my life, I have experienced many rituals and practices are around food and culture. So I want to dicover what is that "special relation" about.

- What if we could trigger determined emotions through food?
- What if food is eaten acording to what you want or need to feel?
- What if we could fabricate (cook) emotions?
- what if food feels emotions?

The main challenge(s): **Food as a socio-emotional human developer for happiness and an empathic world** I am into explore the relationship of humans and food (non human involvement) and how food behaves and act in this relationality. 


### Design Space (always in beta)

My mission:
**Embody a new relationship between (human) emotions and the role of food for the future(s).**


### Intervention #1: The Art of Devouring

#### Why?
As a basic fact, we need to eat to survive. Over time, food has transformed not only in a basic need, but a way to make conversation, provoking meeting points between people. Many times we take for granted the intimate relationship that is generated between the one who cooks, the one(s) who eat(s) and the food itself. Food can be not only an excuse to gather around, but also a main actor in the relations we need to have as humanbeings.

What if food could express their emotions? Post-human approach shifting the role of food.

#### What?
This intervention turns food into artists, allowing them to express their emotions (in the process of cooking) before being devoured by humans.

#### How?
Choosing different recipes and cooking them using white paper as a base. During the process (in each paper used) the food leaved a mark, which was a unique "piece of art" as a food emotional expression.

After eating each plate, I analyzed each painting asking myself "What is food trying to express?" and named each piece of art, fulfilling myself a role of art critic. 

**The art exhibition: <https://www.behance.net/gallery/136609447/The-art-of-devouring>**

Each painting can be seen as a single vignette (autoethnographic design) because it is a short scene of a story, describing one specific moment in the food fabrication process. 

For exploring the perception of others (and collecting more data) a questionnaire with all the art pieces was shared. People can comment what they think and feel about each painting.

#### Lessons Learned
- This intervention was situated using autoethnographic design: cooking as a way to express my creativity, reduce anxiety and help mantaining focus. I was aware of my emotions and the "sharing of food" as a way of demonstrating care and love for others. 
- What food "feels" is determined by human perception and traditional communication, so it will always be a subjetive exercise for speculative design. Technology could be an excellent tool for finding new ways of comunication with a non human. We can collaborate with food (no-human approach).
- The process of cooking (maker) and eating (user) is meaningful and intime, there is no boundaries between. Food transforms into a special partner. 
- Senses do not have have a hierarchical order when humans relate with food, they are complementary and needed according to the objetive of the intervention.
