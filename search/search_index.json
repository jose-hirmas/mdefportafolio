Personal Development Plan \u00b6 What I want to learn and develop? \u00b6 My New Me \u00b6 To construct my design and creativity attitude I got really inspired by Nasa\u00b4s I.S.R.U (In Situ Resource Utilization) and I am applying some methods that artist Tom Sachs defined as part of his creative way: output first thing in the morning, do what you love, setup is everything, start easy, patience, forgive yourself of perfectionism, make to do lists. Experiment: Positive Foods Lunch \u00b6 Role of Prototyping: Means of Enquiry The purpose of this experiment was to explore the relationship between food and emotions for people. Also to explore \u201cmaking\u201d food as a process and the changes in the materials (shape, color, taste, etc) when cooking. I invited everyone in the class to bring their foods to share with these indications: I choose to make Choripan con Pebre : this is a traditional Chilean informal dish that we use to eat in barbeques, when gathering with friends and for celebrating important dates (such as the Independence Day). The plate is composed of: Bread, Chorizo, and the sauce called pebre has tomato, onion and cilantro. The day of the experiment almost all the class participated, many exciting faces and positive comments about the idea. There was a lot of different food! Meanwhile everyone was eating and sharing I made some short interviews just to know the feelings and thoughts about this food experience. Conclusions: Everyone related their food to some special memory of their local town/city. It was surprising that almost everyone brought something of their country. During the experience you feel \u201cthe joy energy\u201d surrounding us. Also the sense of community and the \u201csharing\u201d took place as the key element of the experience. Food produces happines ? I will have to explore types of food and what produces in organism (serotonine, dopamine). Many people asked me if we are going to repeat this experience, as a tradition. My Interests \u00b6 After sharing interests with my classmates, we were grouped together in \u201cUnlearning to Learn\u201d, talk about experiments, ideas and new \u201cto do things\u201d. It was very good seeing the touchpoints we have with each other: This week I get really empowered with Ron Wakkary\u2019s seminar about post human centered design, specially with the concept of \u201cdesign with\u201d which makes me wonder about how my design project has to be developed with relationality between humans and things. We don\u00b4t design alone, we need to negiotate with others. Documentation beyond Presentation \u00b6 When documenting we represent the world with our own perception. In this way, documentation is not apart from our 1PP but is part of the process. Through my experience, I have been with \u201cmy senses open for exploration\u201d. The tools I am using to document are very simple: notebook, pen and phone (for pictures and videos). In my notebook I use to make visual maps of the concepts and ideas. I am experimenting in the documentation process by paying attention to the words and concepts that everyone use in my sorroundings. This has make me focus in language and word usage to understand what is happening around. I am using my notebook to write the exact sentences of the concepts and ideas that I want to capture. So everyday I have between 5 - 20 phrases of people (including my own sentences). This sentences are transformed into quotes. The text input is cronologically captured transforming sentences into small \u201cquote stories\u201d. Each sentence has a choosen word or concept that is used for making a final quote of the story. The result is an abstract, deep and poetic set of quotes summarizing the documentation process. The video shows 7 different \u201cquote stories\u201d, each one is an act that can be interpreted in any way. Sound is used as a complementary tool to guide the viewer and help in the imagination of new realities. Insights of this experience: Context always affects the words and sense of language. Sound is a complementary tool for creating new realities. Writing notes is not efficient for capturing all the moments, but it makes me aware of every single word. When writing a note you inmediatelly take the phrase of its context and can play with it. Organizing the documentation as a theater act (actor and producer) is a good way of self-communication and made me understand better the personal process in first person perspective. Collective Design Intervention \u00b6 As part of the \u201cUnlearning to learn\u201d group, we had the assignment of designing a collective intervention. During the last weeks we start sharing our personal interests and trying to define a collective challenge. After exposing my own interests with the group (process of fabrication, human\u2019s relations and what they feel, new ways of education and food culture), everyone exposed their interests too and we analyze and connect them to a group challenge. At the same time, we started contacting different people, exposing our ideas and concerns, with an open attitude and active listening. Many lessons and some insights appeared in the way. Meeting with Kate: Learning versus the education system. We have different approaches about learning (lets frame it) Set the playground of our intervention: why, what, how, where Meeting with Clement : Prepare well formulated questions. Simple language for involving the community Design a intervention to be fun (for social attraction) Input-Output-Outcome-Impact Look events and make the intervention there Visit to Can Batll\u00f3: The intervention can be made in an open space. What about graffiti as a tool for expression? Examples of organized communities and cooperatives. After discussing and sharing experiences, we decided this as our collective challenge: We studied in systems created by the needs of previous generations and led by them. Today\u2019s needs changed and the hierarchy in teaching and learning should change as well. How can we change what we learn and how we learn it?, How can we create new ways of learning, by raising our voice and showing our needs?, How can we be aware of those needs? This is the first map of my learning process , which I shared with our group. I started putting out the day I was born. From this I thought about important moments in my life (grey circles) and related to learning moments (blue circles), focusing in the emotions and feelings of that learning experience(red circles). From this moment on, APRENDIZAJE EMOCIONANTE emerged. What is it? \u00b6 Exploration about different ways of learning of people in Barcelona, by collecting their individual learning paths. We invited people to draw a map of their learning journey and thell us the story behind key moments. How do we imagined it? \u00b6 People will draw their personal learning maps and make a reflection about it. After that they will choose one lesson of their own map and make a drawing or painting of an emotion or feeling that resume the experience. All the drawings will be hanged and exhibit in an open space for people getting inspired with other\u00b4s stories. Prototyping the Activity \u00b6 The first prototype of the activity was with some chilean and italian friends at my house, where after talking about our own learning experiences in barcelona, I asked them to draw their learning paths and after some minutes we shared these between us. I also shared my own experience and learning path. Insights: When I expose myself to others, others also expose themselves. It is a way of creating horizontal relationships. The exercise is an excuse for people start telling their life story. The time is important for everyone to get a deep reflection and really connect with the work. The space is crucial: we were having some drinks in a cozy and intime scenario. The second prototype of the activity was during lunch time with two classmates. The scenario was a table in a nice sunny terrace, after going to Materfad and discover amazing biomaterials. The conversation was very intime and emotional, talking about prorities in life and concerns about relationships. Insights: After sharing I asked them to resume all this work in one word. This was going to be very powerfull for our exhibition and how we communicate our intervention. Small groups generate a intime atmosphere where conversation is much deep. The Intervention \u00b6 After sending some emails to places we thought would be good for our intervention, finally decided to make it in Three Marks Coffee, because they liked the idea! We arrived to the coffee shop early and it was closed, but after some time waiting they opened and we saw the space. At first we were nervous and a bit shy, did not know how to start or in which part of the space to set all things. We had some coffee and prepare ourselves, choosing second floor as the best space to make the intervention. and we wait for people\u2026 Inspired by the vibe I sat on a chair and start making again my own learning path: Insights: We meet people from different backgrounds and cultures that tell us their learning journeys and some life experiences. (Example: Saudi arabian couple in honey moon told their story) New opportunities of intervention raise (Example: there is a teacher that wants to do this with his students) People gets inspired by the intervention (Example: a guy told us that he will present his learning path as part of his PhD) The Second Intervention \u00b6 We planned to do an open space intervention in Mariposa Park. The idea was to explore with other materials and painting tools, giving people the freedom to use whatever they wanted. Insights: Not many people came. It was a cold day, and the people that was in the park wanted to relax and did not participate. We had some classmates that participated, but very fast because of time. They did not used any special material that we had brought (only paper and pencil). Grafitti painting was introduced by Nikita in his own learning map. Why the intervention was important for me? \u00b6 Understand others learning paths and backgrounds, enhancing my empathy. Connect with my own history, remembering special moments of my learning journey and the triggers of my personal development. Discover the relationship of emotions and learnings through my life. Next steps for the collective design intervention \u00b6 Continue exploring and collecting learning paths ind different spaces around Barcelona. Communicate our work in social media (instagram). Analyze the data that we have gathered and reflect about the experience. Make an outcome out of this. The question for this moment has been: What is my role as a designer? Aprendizaje Emocionante: The Card Game \u00b6 As a collective we decided to prototype a game that could make people explore, reflect and share different learning moments of their lives. For this, we selected anonymously some special quotes of the people we met during our design intervention. Beneath every quote we defined a mini challenge related to the topic of the quote. With this we complete 16 cards with one quote and one challenge. The rules for the game were: Pick a card Read the quote Read the challenge Make it real Share your learning experience During the Design Dialogues 1 we had the opportunity to play and share learning experiences betweeen some of our classmates, tutors and visits. Also, we continue making the intervention about discovering the learning paths, hanging all the drawings in a welcoming place to get inspired. My Fight (version 2.0) \u00b6 Emotions are present in every human interaction. I am extremely aware about how emotions affect people\u00b4s living. We educate ourselves during all our lives and the best learnings are in cotidian and simple moments, triggering emotions. This process in meaninfull for the person\u00b4s personal and social development, constructing the learning path and influences the decisions we make as humanbeings. If we connect with the process (what is happening right now) and change our mindset not focusing mainly in the result, we will enjoy each moment, lower the anxiety about the future, and maybe make better decisions for tomorrow. The gap between \u201cemotions\u201d, \u201cprocess\u201d and \u201clearning\u201d is what I am interested about. That is the design loop: from external to internal, from \u201cwhat you do\u201d to \u201cwhat you feel\u201d.","title":"Design Studio 1"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#design-studio-1","text":"","title":"Design Studio 1"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#design-vision-of-how-our-social-world-could-be-in-the-near-future","text":"My vision is to generate spaces for human relations and their educational and social development, empowering in the need of being part of something, accepting each others realities, empathizing, sharing and creating community as a main concept.","title":"Design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future:"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#personal-development-plan","text":"","title":"Personal Development Plan"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#what-i-want-to-learn-and-develop","text":"","title":"What I want to learn and develop?"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#my-new-me","text":"To construct my design and creativity attitude I got really inspired by Nasa\u00b4s I.S.R.U (In Situ Resource Utilization) and I am applying some methods that artist Tom Sachs defined as part of his creative way: output first thing in the morning, do what you love, setup is everything, start easy, patience, forgive yourself of perfectionism, make to do lists.","title":"My New Me"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%201/#experiment-positive-foods-lunch","text":"Role of Prototyping: Means of Enquiry The purpose of this experiment was to explore the relationship between food and emotions for people.

The first person perspective approach has been a new way of discovering the world, making me conscious about a new designer mindset. During my past professional career, I had been designing social projects for others with a traditional human centered approach, so now it is more evident to feel the intervention(s), redefining the concept of empathy and \u201cputting on the other\u00b4s shoes\u201d. This has been meaningful not only in the way I start understanding deeply what is happening around me, but also slowly transforming myself into a doer (a maker). Some examples of this were the \u201cPositive foods\u201d (cooking, eating and sharing), \u201cFabrication for Someone You Love\u201d (designing, fabricating and using the fab lab tools) and \u201cAprendizaje Emocionante\u201d (drawing, sharing and making conversation). At the same point, when \u201cdesigning with\u201d I am feeling more confident about my skills and attitudes, and more aware about my weaknesses and aspects to improve. So, I will continue doing. Going out of my head and putting the energy in my hands. My mind has been full of ideas, and I have been always reflecting and over thinking things, which has been over time conflicted in my decision making. Trying not having preconcibed ideas , staying in the flow of what is happening right now, listening to others (and trying to talk less) with a humble attitude, and working in different groups (with different backgrounds) it has been a powerful choice. Instead of trying to control what is going to happen, I am open to uncertainty, and new opportunities and never imagined futures are suddenly appearing. This is important for me and is slowing my way of living and anxiety towards the future. It is not only about living in the present, but also having the ability of getting from each experience what is meaningful. In this way, the documentation process has been an excellent complementary tool for taking my learnings to a next level of understanding and making me aware of what is important. Also, I can prioritize my thoughts and when communicating my work and journey to others, be clearer and feel connected. This documentation and communication have helped me transforming words and concepts into realities. So, the more I talk about something, the more real is that \u201csomething\u201d. In this matter, for having a more solid base I want to focus some energy also on research. My personal formula: 70% Act + 20% Reflect + 10% Research. This master has been the STARTING POINT OF SOMETHING . For me, design is not about a product outcome, but an exercise of interventions in a defined system that is in constantly movement. It is not about the final result, but a circular process (learning loops) where you go gaining feedback. New project goals for this term: - Trying new things. You dont\u2019t know until you know. - Keep understanding where I am standing right now. - Don\u2019t forget my own skills and attitudes. - Connect what is important for me, with what is important for others. - Design a specific outcome (land my ideas and vision) My Interests and What is Happening \u00b6 My main interests, which I had been driven and exploring, can be sintetize into: emotions , fabrication process , alternative learning . In order to connect this topics I choose Food as the medium. I have a special relation with food, more than just nutrition or eating. During all my life, I have experienced many rituals and practices are around food and culture. So I want to dicover what is that \u201cspecial relation\u201d about. What if we could trigger determined emotions through food? What if food is eaten acording to what you want or need to feel? What if we could fabricate (cook) emotions? what if food feels emotions? The main challenge(s): Food as a socio-emotional human developer for happiness and an empathic world I am into explore the relationship of humans and food (non human involvement) and how food behaves and act in this relationality. Design Space (always in beta) \u00b6 https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOUUri6Q=/?invite_link_id=223047973361) Intervention #1: The Art of Devouring \u00b6 My mission: Embody a new relationship between (human) emotions and the role of food for the future(s). Why? \u00b6 As a basic fact, we need to eat to survive. Over time, food has transformed not only in a basic need, but a way to make conversation, provoking meeting points between people. Many times we take for granted the intimate relationship that is generated between the one who cooks, the one(s) who eat(s) and the food itself. Food can be not only an excuse to gather around, but also a main actor in the relations we need to have as humanbeings. What if food could express their emotions? Post-human approach shifting the role of food. What? \u00b6 This intervention turns food into artists, allowing them to express their emotions (in the process of cooking) before being devoured by humans. How? \u00b6 Choosing different recipes and cooking them using white paper as a base. During the process (in each paper used) the food leaved a mark, which was a unique \u201cpiece of art\u201d as a food emotional expression. After eating each plate, I analyzed each painting asking myself \u201cWhat is food trying to express?\u201d and named each piece of art, fulfilling myself a role of art critic. The art exhibition: https://www.behance.net/gallery/136609447/The-art-of-devouring Each painting can be seen as a single vignette (autoethnographic design) because it is a short scene of a story, describing one specific moment in the food fabrication process. For exploring the perception of others (and collecting more data) a questionnaire with all the art pieces was shared. People can comment what they think and feel about each painting. Lessons Learned \u00b6 This intervention was situated using autoethnographic design: cooking as a way to express my creativity, reduce anxiety and help mantaining focus. I was aware of my emotions and the \u201csharing of food\u201d as a way of demonstrating care and love for others. What food \u201cfeels\u201d is determined by human perception and traditional communication, so it will always be a subjetive exercise for speculative design. Technology could be an excellent tool for finding new ways of comunication with a non human. We can collaborate with food (no-human approach). The process of cooking (maker) and eating (user) is meaningful and intime, there is no boundaries between. Food transforms into a special partner. Senses do not have have a hierarchical order when humans relate with food, they are complementary and needed according to the objetive of the intervention. For the Future(s) \u00b6 What makes meaningfull a food experience? What makes us humans? What makes them food? What if we change our relationship and concepts about it? How food can help to make better relations for human beings? Is cooking considered a therapy? Benefits for health? (Culinary Art therapy) Food Trends 2022: Serving nostalgia, reduce meat, fusion flavours, superfood. How to make a food lab for research? After this intervention I had the opportunity of talking to some people for feedback and also for searching ways of collaboration. During this process I managed to connect some dots in relation to my past work and my actual interests: what I have being doing in an invisible form is \u201cgiving voice to agents that usually do not have it \u201c . My project is about developing mecanisms of communication in the intervention. A new path of exploration emerged, I called it LEAVING SOME SPACE . \u00b6 why? Searching new empathic relationships between humans and things how? Interventions that show the potential mechanisms of communication and new narratives for creating alternative realities why? Radical exploration and research practice for understanding the present and for imagining future(s) manifesto We create realities from stories. A story can be good, bad, crazy, profound, happy, sad, funny, intense, boring, intimate. It can be whatever, depending of whom is telling it. What if we give a voice to agents that usually do not have it? Let us explore new narratives for communicating what is happening around. Let us be truly responsible for generating awareness about critical scenarios. Let us LEAVE SOME SPACE for creating alternative realities. link: https://cargocollective.com/leavingsomespace/ Intervention #2: The Speech of Things \u00b6 What if we pay attention to everyday things and try to understand their existence? For this intervention I imagined that things around can have a different role for society. What if we see them from a spectator view, giving the opportunity to understand their role beyond their traditional being? Speech 1: The bench \u00b6 On top of a single bench of the park (Parque de la Ciutadella), I placed a small piece of cardboard written: \u201cDo not miss this speech\u201d and a qr-code that linked to the following question: \u201cWhat do you think the bench wants to tell us?\u201d and people could respond to it. I sat in the grass with my camera focusing the bench. I did the same in other benches of the park. What happened? Now one pays attention to the bench itself. It is just a utility for sitting in the park. The bench is a tool for humans who want to: rest in the park, have a conversation with someone else, eat something or just sit and stare at the surroundings. Only two young people saw the piece of cardboard and I think they tried to see what was the qr code about, but no responses for the question at all. After being a couple of hours in the park I felt a bit silly and frustrated because the intervention did not go as I was expecting. I also felt vulnerable and embarrassed about sharing my personal ideas or the \u201cwhat was supposed to happen\u201d. When analyzing this, the radical concept comes to my mind. For me it is about believing in what you think, above all circumstances. Positive attitude, resilience and being brave are characteristics that build my radicality. Speech of the bench (as a personal reflection): \u201cNo one cares about me. I am here all day, in the same position and place, waiting for someone to come. Sometimes the sun is drying my body, sometimes the rain makes me wet. Day and night. Waiting. Sooner or later humans sit on top of me, and I feel company. I listen to their stories. Witness a kiss. And just for some seconds, I feel I belong to a place.\u201d Speech 2: The Chair \u00b6 In the MDEF classroom I took a black chair and put it on front with the same piece of cardboard that I had used before with the bench. I left it like that for one day. Anonymous people add ideas and collectively this speech was created: Dear overweight humans, Hey there! Sit your tush right on over here. Please lose some weight. Your obesity strains my existence. I don\u2019t care about your medical condition. Just pay me some respect, please. You people are strange. I\u2019ve been observing you from time to time, you shift your weight. As a chair, I find this behavior bizarre. Please explain. I feel so exposed like this. Better to fold me up and put me in the corner. Help! I am being exploited as a prop in a design intervention! I have not consented to this! I can potentially change the world. Hahaha. Thanks, Chair. Speech 3: The Sea \u00b6 One day walking on the coast, I noticed that the sea itself was telling us something special. I grab my phone and start filming this. Instead of trying to understand and explain the speech you can see the speech itself. Speech 4: Gravity \u00b6 Lessons Learned \u00b6 Things have agency and are meaningful in a context. Also everything is in relation to another. For example: a wave is the relationship between a specific amount of wind, a portion of the sea, and the location of the moon. In a way, these three things are aligned in a unique form that create what we humans call \u201cwave\u201d. What about other agents we are not aware of that affect the fabrication of this wave? How we find these invisible relations that make the reality possible? For me, \u201cto design\u201d means to understand the relationship between humans and non- humans. In this matter, relationality is fundamental when describing the being. Exploring the interconnection between everyone and everything, and discovering hidden forces of ecology can be a trigger for shifting our role in the world. When I say \u201cthings\u201d I mean \u201ceverything and everyone that exists\u201d. Things do not exist without other things around. When changing this context where things emerge, new things appear. This is attached to the biography of each thing. Each biography is a story, and each story has a unique meaning due to a context. Senses are the human tools for creating and understanding reality. Each thing (interconnection in a context) is also a message. Messages construct narratives, and these narratives are usually curated by humans thanks to communication. The way we communicate in a traditional present or to \u201chave voice\u201d is primary human centered, and the reality is created from this empowered point of view. For the Future(s) \u00b6 How we find invisible (and new) relations between humans and non humans that make the alternative realities possible and generate positive impact? What if we could find new relationships that help overcome critical escenarios of the present? Making an art exhibition for reflection. Is awareness the first step for generating change? How to provoke humans? Intervention #3: Immigrant Beer (in process) \u00b6 Why This intervention is about exploring the relationship between immigrants and beer. I have a special relationship with beer. I love to taste different types of beer and is as a trigger for generating a conversation and creating community. During the last months I started crafting my own beer at my house, so apart from enjoying its flavour, aroma, color and branding, I began understanding its fabrication process. Little by little it is transforming in a passion. Also, living in Barcelona has make me aware of what it feels and means to be an immigrant. It is the first time in my life I feel it in a personal form. What if beer can represent an immigrant\u2019s point of view? How to embed immigrant\u2019s feelings, thoughts, and experience into a bottle of beer? What Crafting beer with a group of immigrants and sharing personal thoughts, feelings and stories. How I lead a collective beer brewing workshop where we talked about immigration and how beer can represent us. Participants where invited and they need to meet two requirements: 1. Consider themselves as immigrants. 2. Consider themselves beer lovers. And we make beer together: During the process we shared thoughts about immigration and our own experience. For this I prepared some questions that guided the conversation: - Who are you? Describe yourself from a immigrant perspective and from a beer perspective . - Imagine that this beer represents an immigrant. How would the beer be? Results The beer is now in the process of fermentation and gasification (30 days). Everyone responded a survey after the intervention, so this is the data collected: It was a very interesting and I enjoyed the intervention because of the special attachment I have to beer craft, and also it served as an excuse to talk in deep about where we come from.

The first person perspective approach has been a new way of discovering the world, making me conscious about a new designer mindset. During my past professional career, I had been designing social projects for others with a traditional human centered approach, so now it is more evident to feel the intervention(s), redefining the concept of empathy and \u201cputting on the other\u00b4s shoes\u201d. This has been meaningful not only in the way I start understanding deeply what is happening around me, but also slowly transforming myself into a doer (a maker). Some examples of this were the \u201cPositive foods\u201d (cooking, eating and sharing), \u201cFabrication for Someone You Love\u201d (designing, fabricating and using the fab lab tools) and \u201cAprendizaje Emocionante\u201d (drawing, sharing and making conversation). At the same point, when \u201cdesigning with\u201d I am feeling more confident about my skills and attitudes, and more aware about my weaknesses and aspects to improve. So, I will continue doing. Going out of my head and putting the energy in my hands. My mind has been full of ideas, and I have been always reflecting and over thinking things, which has been over time conflicted in my decision making. Trying not having preconcibed ideas , staying in the flow of what is happening right now, listening to others (and trying to talk less) with a humble attitude, and working in different groups (with different backgrounds) it has been a powerful choice. Instead of trying to control what is going to happen, I am open to uncertainty, and new opportunities and never imagined futures are suddenly appearing. This is important for me and is slowing my way of living and anxiety towards the future. It is not only about living in the present, but also having the ability of getting from each experience what is meaningful. In this way, the documentation process has been an excellent complementary tool for taking my learnings to a next level of understanding and making me aware of what is important. Also, I can prioritize my thoughts and when communicating my work and journey to others, be clearer and feel connected. This documentation and communication have helped me transforming words and concepts into realities. So, the more I talk about something, the more real is that \u201csomething\u201d. In this matter, for having a more solid base I want to focus some energy also on research. My personal formula: 70% Act + 20% Reflect + 10% Research. This master has been the STARTING POINT OF SOMETHING . For me, design is not about a product outcome, but an exercise of interventions in a defined system that is in constantly movement. It is not about the final result, but a circular process (learning loops) where you go gaining feedback. New project goals for this term: - Trying new things. You dont\u2019t know until you know. - Keep understanding where I am standing right now. - Don\u2019t forget my own skills and attitudes. - Connect what is important for me, with what is important for others. - Design a specific outcome (land my ideas and vision)","title":"My journey so far"},{"location":"design%20studio/Design%20Studio%202/#my-interests-and-what-is-happening","text":"My main interests, which I had been driven and exploring, can be sintetize into: emotions , fabrication process , alternative learning .

This challenge was a good speculative design exercise for imagining a world where kids have a responsibility, validation among adults and shifting their role in society (empowered by the decisions we need to make as humanity). As a team we managed to define our roles which led to a clarity in tasks, responsibility towards the process and collaborating with each other consistently. My main role was about co-developing the purpose of the game and the fabrication process, so my main working space was in the fablab with machines. It was the first time I used the laser cutting machine and I learned the parameters and process of doing a work with it. Observations: The final prototype did not cut well with the laser cutting machine because of lens was dirty (or/and parameters where mistaken) and we did not had the opportuniy to use the machine again, so I had to cut and polish the pieces of the game by hand with let to a lot of time wasting. We used a lot of time planning and developing the theoretical design of the game, leaving little time for laser cutting and almost no time for trying the game. For the next time we need to validate in real life the design prototypes. Mixing materials for the prototypes gave us powerfull insights for defining the next steps. We started with post-it and strings (prototype 1), then used cardboard (prototype 2), and finally we used MDF, spray paint and ropes (protoype 3). Pantomimic was also a good tool for imagining the game and defining the relationship betweeen players. For scalability we thought of using cardboard and adjusting the parameters to cut enough to fit on the cardboard, by this we give each group the cardboard sheet and ropes needed. Each group can first customize their own game by painting the pieces and then take the pieces out themselves. I need to keep on using CAD softwares for improving my skills drawing objects.

Observations: The final prototype did not cut well with the laser cutting machine because of lens was dirty (or/and parameters where mistaken) and we did not had the opportuniy to use the machine again, so I had to cut and polish the pieces of the game by hand with let to a lot of time wasting. We used a lot of time planning and developing the theoretical design of the game, leaving little time for laser cutting and almost no time for trying the game. For the next time we need to validate in real life the design prototypes. Mixing materials for the prototypes gave us powerfull insights for defining the next steps. We started with post-it and strings (prototype 1), then used cardboard (prototype 2), and finally we used MDF, spray paint and ropes (protoype 3). Pantomimic was also a good tool for imagining the game and defining the relationship betweeen players. For scalability we thought of using cardboard and adjusting the parameters to cut enough to fit on the cardboard, by this we give each group the cardboard sheet and ropes needed. Each group can first customize their own game by painting the pieces and then take the pieces out themselves. I need to keep on using CAD softwares for improving my skills drawing objects.","title":"Personal Reflection"},{"location":"fab%20academy/Challenges/#challenge-2-develop-an-artifact-that-allows-you-to-explain-your-project-to-others-or-interact-with-others-so-that-they-understand-your-research-project","text":"For this challenge I worked with Angel and Aparna.","title":"Challenge #2: Develop an artifact \u201cthat allows you to explain your project to others\u201d or \u201cinteract with others so that they understand your research project.\u201d"},{"location":"fab%20academy/Weekly%20Tasks/","text":"Weekly Tasks and Reflections \u00b6 W1 - Principles and Practices, Project management \u00b6 During the MDEF, my documentation has been made using git and some basics of html, which was a big challenge.

For me, traditional education is obsolete in latam and the world. I have been making classes in public rural schools back in Chile, where I have evidence the importance of bonding between students and teacher-student, for their integral formation. Also interested in how learning by doing and gamification can be an excellent tool for children\u00b4s integration. Weak Signals: Emotional Design and Maker Education I believe that emotions are present in every interaction between humans and their environment. Also that the main issues we are facing are because we need to deeply understand what we are feeling and what others also feel. I am really interested in exploring how human emotions can be sustained as a main \u201ccity developer\u201d. We don\u00b4t talk about feelings because we get embarrassed, but we always feel things. The challenge is how we get conscious about our own feelings and emotions, and how we can manage to know new people\u00b4s emotions to understand how body, brain and soul are connected. The learning process is not about theorical and technical skills, but how we can use in the real world all the tools we develop. I like the doing as the best and more effective way to really explore, discover and learn. Since school I have been not a traditional student, I coud not sit in a chair and just listen teachers, always being hyperkinetic and having attention deficit (ADHD) was really a challenge when going to a traditional school and education. Also during my life I have managed to realize that the best way of learning for me was by doing things on my own. The concept of maker is attached to the capacity of creation that we humans are able to. Understanding humans as makers is also seeing us creators, discoverers, imagining new Futures and trying the best ways. Also, to accept that we are not perfect in anyway and that making mistake is not a bad thing, but a way to discover yourself, gain knowledge, and explore the world. Relationship between two weak signals During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. Multiscalar Diagram: The Hike of Emotions During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. We went on a hiking experience for developing the multiscalar diagram On this adventure I decided to pay attention to my emotions during all day. When getting to the Metro station on time: anxiety and a bit of stress because i as a bit late We started de hike joining all together next to a olive tree which is a safe place for me because this is the tree that represents my family. My emotions: safety and comfort. In the walk we had the opportunity to try some native fruit I don\u2019t remember the name but this brought me to my childhood because we had a lot of fruit trees and go around eating them. This provoke me joy and nostalgia. In one part of the hike we had to get in silence and the atmosphere changed. We enter \u201cthe forest\u201d in a really quite mood. There I felt peace and freedom emotions. Also the climate change and it was colder. \u00bfHow do climate changes make you feel? We get to the top and had an amazing view of almost all Barcelona. For the first time I had a sense of dimensions of the city, seeing everything from a different perspective (\u201clooking from the balcony\u201d). I felt small and humble and, in a way, big enough for trying to solve some cities issues. My emotions were dragged to motivation and empowerment. All the way to the top and going down we were also in a happy and exploring mood. My classmates have a nice attitude, so we can talk and go knowing each other more. For me, it is important the relations that we have early constructed with the group, each one with their own backgrounds, cultures, thoughts, and ways of seeing life. We are in a journey together but living it at our own pace. Some questions and notes I have in different scales: How do surroundings make you feel? Design flavors for generating emotions How can we design a city for positive emotions (happy people)? Nature is a guide for emotional design The city can be transformed into a big playing surface. The sense of community is vital for social development We need to bond education and emotions. Collaborative diagram For the collaborative diagram I was amazed with the education issues and thoughts that some of my classmates have, that are really attached to my own beliefs. This make me think that I all not alone on this quest. I liked the concept of \u201ccross generation\u201d and \u201ca playground for everyone\u201d. I will like to contact: - Go to explore some schools and alternative learning methods in Barcelona - Neuroeducation specialist for understanding how emotions and education are bond. - Participate in maker experience Experiment I will like to make: - Design a workshop for understanding kids emotions when going on an learning experience. A new skill for my personal development plan: - learning to fail and trying to focus. - Unlearning to learn. The best: \u00b6 the amazing view from the top of the mountain. The Lessons Learned: \u00b6 There are many futures. Our classmates are usefull resources. Colaboration is relevant for the development of my project. Technology is constructed in a context. The challenges: \u00b6 Change my mindset to exploration and observation in every day. Visit new places to get inspired. Atlas of Weak Signals (Term 2) \u00b6 This seminar was about talking, discussing and reflecting about \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d, specifically of how we are developing (or undeveloping) as humanbeings and the relations that we have with nature. The first class was a roadmap of the world divided into 4 stages: awareness with what is happening (telling the truth), how everything changes (mutation), what is the plan for the future, and actions that are helping to balance and solve social and ecological issues. I got inspired by some art exhibitions and examples that try to generate awareness about critical scenarios: Olafur Elliason\u2019s ice watch, the concept of hyperobject, the mutation of chicken, plastiglomerates, Donna Haraway\u2019s becoming with. The second class was about introducing the concept of surveillance capitalism, and how human phsycology is directly attached to the use of internet and world wide web (\u201cwe are working but we are not aware of that\u201d). We discussed about fake news, attention economy and engagement, extreme personalization, data extractivism, and that we are beggining this new age of web3: crypto, blockchain and DAO (distributed autonomy organization). The third class was about defining what is a job, what it means to work in an era of automatization and AI. Reflecting on what will people do with robots replacing us in traditional jobs. We are facing an uncertain job security for the future that may paralize us or be the trigger to change the perspective and way of living (\u201cyay a robot took over my job, now I can enjoy life\u201d). A new concept arises here: the caring economy. The fourth class was about \u201cafter the nation-state\u201d, defining the difference between \u201cnation\u201d (culture and people) and \u201cstate\u201d (politics). We had to respond: Where are we from? so it was very interesting to reflect about my own life because I feel chilean but not latin and have palestinian, hungarian and spanish roots. After seeing the video of the class, new concepts appear such as: rural-urban division, anti immigration movements and refugees. Also the question that arises is: Is there an alternative of a political-social organization that is not a nation-state? Weak signals: global movements, tech that bypasses state control, new infraestructural wars, relocating nations because of climate crisis, new colonialisms. The wish-list: global finance regulation, global flexible democracy and a new shape of citizenship. Reflection \u00b6 I have lived all my life in Santiago de Chile, a city that for the last 30 years has been very stable in terms of political, social and economic growth, and feel very privileged to have had a good quality of life, which in some way is luck. Since my early professional career I had tried to move from my state of comfort, having the opportunity to know and feel the other side of Chile, understanding the main problems that we are facing as a nation-state. Also feeling very responsible and with the power to help and make changes. Silently the problems began to grow, and we hide them with this \u201cfalse hapinness economic growth\u201d. The last 3 years all this \u201cfalse happiness\u201d and the people\u2019s feelings began to be visible, uncovering the pot of a social crisis that affects everyone. This local movement has make us aware and unstable basic principles of the way we live. Moreover the pandemic has added changes of paradigms and lifestyles. The first step is \u201copening your eyes\u201d and see beyond what you have always seen. Going out of Chile, and living in Barcelona, that is a multicultural city, has make me aware of some critical issues that we are facing as humanity. I feel sensibility for immigrants and refugees, in a way because is part of my personal family story, but also because for the first time I am living with the immigrant perception. In relation to technology, as a young student I had access to internet and social media, but never was too enthusiastic about it so i have always preferred direct relationships and traditional ways of communicating. Maybe this is because emotions and energy are important and feels as a necesity to be in direct contact with other humans. In this matter, during the last years, to work from my computer has been a challenge and when spending too much time in front of the screen I feel the necessity to reconect with the \u201creal world\u201d. I am not afraid of automatization because I think humans can not be replaced 100%. Where do I come from? I feel very chilean and this means that I am part of a country that was built and has grow with the immigrants coming over the years. I love the landscapes of Chile, the food and the people that I am sorrounded. The mix of cultures has been present in my life, in my case palestinian ancestry mixed with hungarian and spanish roots. When I see now new refugees (mainly from central america) coming to my country in search for opportunities I feel empathy. Another idea is that for me Chile is not part of Latin America. We are so different to other countries that are in the same continent, and sometimes I feel we are alone, isolated and not wanting to be part of the south american culture. I believe that a community gets richer when you have different backgrounds trying to decide about how we live, what we need and what we want. Why do walls between countries still exist? I think there is fear and feeling vulnerable, lack of communication marked with prejudices and fake news. From each state there is a sense of competition based on the capitalist model, that has polarized the society, individualizing benefits and misunderstanding that we are all part of the same world. Let us not take the sense of community for granted. We need to talk more to others. We need to listen more to others. And convince ourselves that we are all interconnected.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals (Term 1)"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals-term-1","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals (Term 1)"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#lo-esencial-es-invisibles-a-los-ojos-antoine-de-saint-exupery","text":"The weak signals I chose are \u201cEmotional Design\u201d and \u201cMaker Education\u201d, this is because I have interests in the relationship and interactions between human beings and how emotions play a role in the social educational development.

I am really interested in exploring how human emotions can be sustained as a main \u201ccity developer\u201d. We don\u00b4t talk about feelings because we get embarrassed, but we always feel things. The challenge is how we get conscious about our own feelings and emotions, and how we can manage to know new people\u00b4s emotions to understand how body, brain and soul are connected. The learning process is not about theorical and technical skills, but how we can use in the real world all the tools we develop. I like the doing as the best and more effective way to really explore, discover and learn. Since school I have been not a traditional student, I coud not sit in a chair and just listen teachers, always being hyperkinetic and having attention deficit (ADHD) was really a challenge when going to a traditional school and education. Also during my life I have managed to realize that the best way of learning for me was by doing things on my own. The concept of maker is attached to the capacity of creation that we humans are able to. Understanding humans as makers is also seeing us creators, discoverers, imagining new Futures and trying the best ways. Also, to accept that we are not perfect in anyway and that making mistake is not a bad thing, but a way to discover yourself, gain knowledge, and explore the world. Relationship between two weak signals During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. Multiscalar Diagram: The Hike of Emotions During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. We went on a hiking experience for developing the multiscalar diagram On this adventure I decided to pay attention to my emotions during all day. When getting to the Metro station on time: anxiety and a bit of stress because i as a bit late We started de hike joining all together next to a olive tree which is a safe place for me because this is the tree that represents my family. My emotions: safety and comfort. In the walk we had the opportunity to try some native fruit I don\u2019t remember the name but this brought me to my childhood because we had a lot of fruit trees and go around eating them. This provoke me joy and nostalgia. In one part of the hike we had to get in silence and the atmosphere changed. We enter \u201cthe forest\u201d in a really quite mood. There I felt peace and freedom emotions. Also the climate change and it was colder. \u00bfHow do climate changes make you feel? We get to the top and had an amazing view of almost all Barcelona. For the first time I had a sense of dimensions of the city, seeing everything from a different perspective (\u201clooking from the balcony\u201d). I felt small and humble and, in a way, big enough for trying to solve some cities issues. My emotions were dragged to motivation and empowerment. All the way to the top and going down we were also in a happy and exploring mood. My classmates have a nice attitude, so we can talk and go knowing each other more. For me, it is important the relations that we have early constructed with the group, each one with their own backgrounds, cultures, thoughts, and ways of seeing life. We are in a journey together but living it at our own pace. Some questions and notes I have in different scales: How do surroundings make you feel? Design flavors for generating emotions How can we design a city for positive emotions (happy people)? Nature is a guide for emotional design The city can be transformed into a big playing surface. The sense of community is vital for social development We need to bond education and emotions. Collaborative diagram For the collaborative diagram I was amazed with the education issues and thoughts that some of my classmates have, that are really attached to my own beliefs. This make me think that I all not alone on this quest. I liked the concept of \u201ccross generation\u201d and \u201ca playground for everyone\u201d. I will like to contact: - Go to explore some schools and alternative learning methods in Barcelona - Neuroeducation specialist for understanding how emotions and education are bond. - Participate in maker experience Experiment I will like to make: - Design a workshop for understanding kids emotions when going on an learning experience. A new skill for my personal development plan: - learning to fail and trying to focus. - Unlearning to learn.","title":"\"Lo esencial es invisibles a los ojos\" (Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry)"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#the-best","text":"the amazing view from the top of the mountain.","title":"The best:"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#the-lessons-learned","text":"There are many futures.

The first class was a roadmap of the world divided into 4 stages: awareness with what is happening (telling the truth), how everything changes (mutation), what is the plan for the future, and actions that are helping to balance and solve social and ecological issues. I got inspired by some art exhibitions and examples that try to generate awareness about critical scenarios: Olafur Elliason\u2019s ice watch, the concept of hyperobject, the mutation of chicken, plastiglomerates, Donna Haraway\u2019s becoming with. The second class was about introducing the concept of surveillance capitalism, and how human phsycology is directly attached to the use of internet and world wide web (\u201cwe are working but we are not aware of that\u201d). We discussed about fake news, attention economy and engagement, extreme personalization, data extractivism, and that we are beggining this new age of web3: crypto, blockchain and DAO (distributed autonomy organization). The third class was about defining what is a job, what it means to work in an era of automatization and AI. Reflecting on what will people do with robots replacing us in traditional jobs. We are facing an uncertain job security for the future that may paralize us or be the trigger to change the perspective and way of living (\u201cyay a robot took over my job, now I can enjoy life\u201d). A new concept arises here: the caring economy. The fourth class was about \u201cafter the nation-state\u201d, defining the difference between \u201cnation\u201d (culture and people) and \u201cstate\u201d (politics). We had to respond: Where are we from? so it was very interesting to reflect about my own life because I feel chilean but not latin and have palestinian, hungarian and spanish roots. After seeing the video of the class, new concepts appear such as: rural-urban division, anti immigration movements and refugees. Also the question that arises is: Is there an alternative of a political-social organization that is not a nation-state? Weak signals: global movements, tech that bypasses state control, new infraestructural wars, relocating nations because of climate crisis, new colonialisms. The wish-list: global finance regulation, global flexible democracy and a new shape of citizenship.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals (Term 2)"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#reflection","text":"I have lived all my life in Santiago de Chile, a city that for the last 30 years has been very stable in terms of political, social and economic growth, and feel very privileged to have had a good quality of life, which in some way is luck. Since my early professional career I had tried to move from my state of comfort, having the opportunity to know and feel the other side of Chile, understanding the main problems that we are facing as a nation-state. Also feeling very responsible and with the power to help and make changes. Silently the problems began to grow, and we hide them with this \u201cfalse hapinness economic growth\u201d. The last 3 years all this \u201cfalse happiness\u201d and the people\u2019s feelings began to be visible, uncovering the pot of a social crisis that affects everyone. This local movement has make us aware and unstable basic principles of the way we live. Moreover the pandemic has added changes of paradigms and lifestyles. The first step is \u201copening your eyes\u201d and see beyond what you have always seen. Going out of Chile, and living in Barcelona, that is a multicultural city, has make me aware of some critical issues that we are facing as humanity. I feel sensibility for immigrants and refugees, in a way because is part of my personal family story, but also because for the first time I am living with the immigrant perception. In relation to technology, as a young student I had access to internet and social media, but never was too enthusiastic about it so i have always preferred direct relationships and traditional ways of communicating. Maybe this is because emotions and energy are important and feels as a necesity to be in direct contact with other humans. In this matter, during the last years, to work from my computer has been a challenge and when spending too much time in front of the screen I feel the necessity to reconect with the \u201creal world\u201d. I am not afraid of automatization because I think humans can not be replaced 100%. Where do I come from? I feel very chilean and this means that I am part of a country that was built and has grow with the immigrants coming over the years. I love the landscapes of Chile, the food and the people that I am sorrounded. The mix of cultures has been present in my life, in my case palestinian ancestry mixed with hungarian and spanish roots. When I see now new refugees (mainly from central america) coming to my country in search for opportunities I feel empathy. Another idea is that for me Chile is not part of Latin America. We are so different to other countries that are in the same continent, and sometimes I feel we are alone, isolated and not wanting to be part of the south american culture. I believe that a community gets richer when you have different backgrounds trying to decide about how we live, what we need and what we want. Why do walls between countries still exist? I think there is fear and feeling vulnerable, lack of communication marked with prejudices and fake news. From each state there is a sense of competition based on the capitalist model, that has polarized the society, individualizing benefits and misunderstanding that we are all part of the same world. Let us not take the sense of community for granted. We need to talk more to others. We need to listen more to others. And convince ourselves that we are all interconnected.","title":"Reflection"},{"location":"seminars/03-BioAgro%20Zero/","text":"Bio Agro Zero \u00b6 \u201cHistory is a process of transformation through conversation.

My magic machine is a roller coaster and in the middle there is a figure of a human being. At first I just starting using some materials that were on top of the table, without knowing what I was doing. I started mixing some discard coffe and a piece of cardboard, and after some time using my hands and exploring the materials some ideas come to my head. I thought about seeing and feeling from different perspectives, so the rollercoaster represents these different points of views and also how emotions change depending on what experience you are living. The rollercoaster never ends, is circular and does not have a \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cfinish\u201d point, so this is related to cycles in life. The person in the middle represents myself and the bravery to be in the middle of this cycles, exploring open minded and trying to see beyond. Some insight that happen during the workshop is that each time I verbally presented my magic machine, I changed or complement my description with more information and thoughts, so when communitating I find new ideas and ways of understanding my own creation. After sharing with the group we get to some relationships between magic machines: - Cycles: we made circular machines and the meaning of living cycles was shared. - Everyone represented the need of \u201clooking for something new\u201d . - The different magic machines showed many possibilites about emotions, decision making, ways of being, languages, growing plants. - We talked about the concept of Perception of freedom as a way of percieving options and possibilites towards life and day living. Emotional Fabrication \u00b6 I decided to design and fabricate a chair , using only what I have at home and trying to do it all by myself. I have never fabricated any furniture ( learning something new ) and also one of my challenges for my new me is to \u201cbecome a maker\u201d of things ( the first day of my new life ). What did I make? And why did it matter? I started this personal project with the idea of fabricating a piece of furniture for my house, so after investigating a bit about different design and fabrication tecniques I decided that a chair would be a good challenge for an amateur maker. The first thing after deciding to do a chair was thinking about materials and the type of chair, but before that I decided that the chair was not for me, but for someone special. This chair would be for my just borned goddaughter that is in Chile. This was a point of inflection for the design process, putting a meaningfull objective for the challenge. I relate this to emotional design and how things provoke emotions on humanbeings. \u201cSimplicity\u201d and\u201dcozy\u201d were some concepts for the design, and the main material would be wood. I present you a design drawing of \u201cSilla Lourdes\u201d: What happens when you involve yourself? The result is not the main purpose of this challenge, but the process of design and fabricating were really important. So I did not finish the chair in one day because of many things happening during the process: Finding the right type of wood in different places around the city. I visited many workshops and shops, trying to find a nice piece of wood at an affordable price. In my home I did not have the materials for fabrication woth wood, so after trying to make holes with forks and other thing I had in the kitchen, I decided to ask for help in Fab Lab. Using the machines was a great experience! When I involved myself and being in a vulnerable position made me feel different emotions during the process. In other words, this challenge affected me in positive and negative ways. Some of this emotions were: excitement, happiness, anxiety, desesperation, nervious, confident, suprised, which I felt in the same day. I got the support of family and friends, so designing and fabricating with others was important for my mindset and determination. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? During all this experience I felt self-challenged with and instrinsic motivation. The first person perspective has been a good approach for understanding and trying to be really empathic. The difficulty shows when documentating because you \u201cget out\u201d of the 1PP, so a dilemma of third person and first person appears. Did anything change about your way of working? As always I started the process thinking to much about what/why/how, so after being overwhelmed with ideas and doubts I decided to \u201cthink less and do more\u201d. The next morning I woke up and went out to street filming myself and people around me, that\u00b4s when the \u201cchair challenge\u201d just got to my head and heart, increasing motivation by doing. What does it mean for your future work? I am interested in emotional design, maker education, sharing with others and social innovation. To fabricate things and use fablab machines is a powerfull new tool for my future work. I am inspired by the maker movement and distributed design as a new way of building and sharing. After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?

Playing with the neural network of human faces: Neural Networks: Universal Declaration of Ants Rights \u00b6 Human beings are not the center of the world. All animals that exist, including small insects, should have rights. So, we created a document that refers to all the rights that ants have. We are using GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3), a third-generation language prediction model by Open AI. No ant shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty. Each individual ant, whether it is worker, drone, or queen, is unique and different. All are entitled to the same rights. All individual ants are equal before the law and should be treated equally. No beings are allowed to interfere with the integrity of an ant colony. All beings are liable to be prosecuted in the Universal Interspecies Court for violation of ant rights. No ant colony may be destroyed or in any way harmed without a court order. No treaty may be signed which deprives ants of their rights as an independent species. The Universal Interspecies Court must have the power to impose appropriate penalties for violation of ant rights. All beings are prohibited from interfering with the free exercise of the ant religion. All beings are required to respect the environment of ants and all other beings. All beings are required to encourage the preservation of ant diversity. All beings are required to abide by these Universal Ant Rights in so far as they respect the independent nature of ants and do not interfere with them. All beings are required to make their best efforts to ensure that the environment of ants and all other beings is protected. All beings are required to encourage peaceful coexistence and the pursuit of harmony between ants and other beings. All beings are prohibited from interfering with the life of an ant colony or any of its members.

The Universal Interspecies Court has the power to impose appropriate penalties for violation of ant rights. The above tewnty one ant rights were formulated by the Ant Rights Project as a basis for further discussion and as a means of protecting ants from human exploitation and abuse. The Ant Rights Project has also developed a draft treaty which would be submitted to the United Nations to prohibit human activities that interfere with the freedom of ants. Wacky Reflection: What do ants think about their rights? What is their opinion? Is there a way to communicate with them? To get further this assignment we could create a form of communication with ants, so they can comment about their own style of living and what rights they think deserve. For example, an idea for this communication between humans and ants could be by the speed they walk and what figures are built by their footprints when walking.

We humanbeings are focused in the future, in what is going to happen, not paying attention to what is happening right now (the present). Also sometimes, we start remembering the past (\u201call the times past was better\u201d) feeling nostalgia. As a group we started discussing about what has been some episodes in our life when we have felt anxious. Is anxiety real? More over, after the pandemia that affects everyone, we are learning again how to relate with others an live in a social world. So the scenario for our assignment is: COVID INDUCED ANXIETY AT AN AIRPORT. Our objective is to design a small wearable that helps alleviate anxiety and warns your close community. Why a ring? 1. Personal and almost invisible wearable that does not expose the user. 2. Information gathering by object attached to hands (blood pressure, heart beat, temperatura, sweating, movement). 3. Unique and important, so as own health awareness. The futures of this intelligent object are: locating safe spaces, anxiety detection and message support. All this connected to a mobile interface that records data (ECG, location,noise Level, motion, temperature). As part of the user experience: adjustable sizes, synz with app, designed for fidgeting, connects wirelessly and releases anxiety medicine when chewed. The goals for the object are: - self-awareness - calmness - mood stability - safety - independece - privacy Some consequences could be: addiction, reliance, over sharing, exposure and infringement. This is a temporary solution for anxiety but not a permanent solution for mental health and anxiety disorders.

Novmerca is situated in the Caribbean islands so according to IPCC predictions, there is a high confidence in sea level increase by 2050. We have been anticipating this situation for decades with new technologies to build and sustain floating cities connected to the initial island. As you can see, we live on a water planet. Our goal is to see how we can transform the way we live life to have a more horizontal relationship with water. One of our major propositions is how we\u2019re going to procure drinking water for our citizens since rainfall is also predicted to decrease. We plan to do this in these ways:from condensation in the humid air, using systems to convert sea water to potable fresh water. We also want to ensure that our water policies are benefiting not only the citizens of Novmerca and our island, but surrounding nations and sea life. We will do this by implementing an exchange fresh water policy where we can offer our clean filtered water as a resource, we want to focus on protection of water species, water cooling system using hydro energy (water AC system), implement water recycling systems Is your city dry? How do you manage to get water? Migration: On our island it will happen that people will emigrate. The sea level is rising and the area of our mainland is decreasing. The projected net population decline is currently diminishing. But of course we are open to immigrants. We are welcoming climate refugees facing similar aquatic challenges with our floating SEATY technologies. We are ready to acquire - 50.000 people. Also we are offering workshops and opensource data to better integrate and build your own shops/houses and floating parts. We are very happy about new ideas and give everyone the chance to get involved. An open source plan to build floating cities. This sounds nice right? Who would participate? How can we build a network between them? Data Governance: At Novmerca, we have developed a participative data transparency policy with an open data platform to give access to all the citizens and environmental data. All the administrative tools are open source and every citizen can see the algorithms behind them and propose improvements. Citizens play an active role in data collection. Everyone can ask for a sensor kit from the city. Citizens also share data on their techniques and make them available to everyone (for example : Construction plans for Floating buildings, methods to produce drinking water, instructions to grow vegetables - Aquaponic) We don\u2019t only give access to this data but encourage citizens to use it and collaborate with them to create solutions! We have DATADIAS every week, where citizens can physically meet and discuss or co-create solutions based on Novmerca data. It has helped us anticipate many crises and this is how we are in this situation today. What if we extended this strategy at a bigger scale than just our city? It would benefit everyone if we had a cross-city strategy and were able to interconnect our data. Wealth Concentration: Our island has defined environmental justice as a main social value, redefining the concept of economy: \u201cwhen one wins, we all win\u201d. The economic model of the city is based on cooperativism, so each citizen is responsible for a part of the island. The percentage of responsibility is calculated depending on sustainability factors and the relationship of each human to nature in the long term. Wealth is measured in terms of our connection with nature and sustainability with the environment. For example: the less materials you use, the richer you are, and more participation in the decisions of the island you can make. The importance and assessment of careers and jobs is adjusted to environmental issues, and everyone receives a worthy salary. We propose the 10X Policy, so for companies the top salary is no more than 10 times the minimum salary. Looking for the best for the world, we think a global currency will make us all aware of the main challenges that we are facing, worrying beyond the borders of the nation, and seeking a common good for the planet. If money is what mobilizes people: should wealth be in the environment instead of money? Nightlife: As citizens we would like the nightlife at Novmerca to contribute to our country. We think nightlife has been an important part of life for thousands of years. But at Novmerca we would like to propose parties of impact where the energy product on the dance floor helps with the courtesy green energy state. We would like all parties to involve headphones to reduce sound pollution and we will dance to the light of the moon. As Novmerca is a city on the water we are researching ways to use spaces underwater to have underwater parties. We would like to leave you with this question: shall nightlife contribute to your city\u2019s energy too??? The best: \u00b6 Discussing \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios and having the opportunity to listen to my classmates reflections about the futures. The Lessons Learned: \u00b6 How to use questions as design tools (what if\u2026) The concept of design as a verb (action) \u201d The future \u201d does not exist. It is a plural concept (futureS) The narratives that we create are powerful, words shape realities The everything manifesto (IAM): we should design for humbleness, responsability, plurality, solidarity, empathy and tolerance. The concept of circadian organism and degrowth. There is a crisis of imagination about how we measure success, life and development. The challenge: \u00b6 Use speculative design to discuss and reflect (enable changing status quo).","title":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds"},{"location":"seminars/08-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#designing-for-the-next-billion-seconds","text":"","title":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds"},{"location":"seminars/08-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#a-bad-idea-teaching-humans-how-to-code-and-machines-how-to-learn-iam-creative-research-lab","text":"First of all, let me clear out:","title":"\"A bad idea: teaching humans how to code and machines how to learn\" (IAM Creative Research Lab)"},{"location":"seminars/08-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#1-billion-seconds-317-years","text":"During this week we discuss and reflect about future(s), time, the everything, technology, human beings and the planet, making important questions that triggers: \u201cWhat futures do we want to remember one billions seconds from now?\u201d","title":"1 Billion Seconds = 31.7 years"},{"location":"seminars/08-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#wtf-is","text":"Future An energy that makes us wake up everyday ang give meaning to existance.

Food Waste Manipulation \u00b6 During this seminar we were introduced to biomaterials and had the opportunity of experimenting using different food waste. Connect: Tangerines and coffee are part of the basic food I have almost everyday. I choose this materials for experimentation because it is a usual material (available almost everywhere) and there is oversupply in Barcelona. Collect: During one week I collected the coffee grounds (of the coffee I drinked) and the tangerine peel in different glass jars. Dry: I used the oven for drying the food waste, putting the temperature low (50-70\u00b0C). The tangerine got dried and after I grind it. The coffee did not get so dry. (I loved the smell of my flat after using the oven!) Material exploration and properties \u00b6 In groups (with Aparna and Joaquin) we did experimentation of biomaterial recipes: Gelatine \u00b6 20gr gelatine 250ml water 15gr glycerin 2ml vinegar 30gr aditives Properties: renewable resource, hydrolyzed collagen derived from animals, local - waste from the meat, pork & fish industries, compostable, industrial use (gastronomy, medicine, farmaceutic). Pine Resine \u00b6 45gr pine resine 15ml alcohol 5gr carnauba wax 40/60gr food waste Properties: renewable resource, natural resin derived from pines, local - Catalunya, antibacterial, biodegradable, industrial use (paper, adhesives, paintings, coatings, farmaceutic). Other biomaterial experimentation \u00b6 It was the first time I experiment with these type of biomaterials and I was impressed by how the process is determined by handcrafting, in a way very similar to cooking food. Each ingredient amount, the heating temperature, the mixing order of each ingredient are significant things for the final result. For this reason, every small change affects the outcome. The material design properties are also essential to understand possible applications so it is not only about the fabrication process , but also to complement this with technical, functional and emotional research about the material that you are exploring. In the material scarcity moment that we are facing as humanity, it is necesarry to keep on looking for alternatives that can be sustainable, being aware of their properties and potential use. The biomaterial production is highly determined by the local waste, making difficult to transform this alternatives in industrial production without harming the environment. For example: in Spanish coasts there is abundant Agar Agar or in Chilean coasts there is abundant sea shell, so each local biomaterials experimentation should use mainly this type of wastes. It is interesting to think the design of new products limited by the use of local biomaterials. This could open new insights for product outcomes and new innovation design opportunities. What if each product was determined by the excess of materials that are available in the near sorroundings?How many alternatives for the same final product can we imagine? Remixing Materials (part two) \u00b6 Materials in Context \u00b6 Around Poblenou we started searching for different material opportunities: human hair, coffee grounds, orange and other fruit peels, mejillones, meat and poultry oil and bread crumbs. We decided to work with Bread Crumbs because: Many supppliers around the city (in Barcelona there is almost one bakery in each street) Common and simple material with a high offering amount Research about the bread loss: https://foodwin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Factsheet-Bread-Waste.pdf Few biomaterials projects related to bread Material SWOT Analysis \u00b6 Cooking Process \u00b6 Two different recipes: Recipe #1 -10g gelatin -125 ml water -7.5ml glycerin -2ml vinegar 20g breadcrumbs Recipe #2 -25g Pine resin -40g breadcrumbs -15ml alcohol -5g carnauba wax Lifecycle of the material \u00b6 Results and Applications \u00b6 Bread crumbs surplust in bcn (\u201calmost a bakery per street\u201d) The format of the food waste has to be passed through a process before making the biomaterial.

Talk 2: Laura Forlano \u00b6 I was inspired by the autoethnographic experience in design, \u201cyou can see the yourself in the world and the world in you\u201d and describing herself as a disabled ciborg. The use of the \u201cwhat if\u201d for triggering questions and ideas that rapidly are transformed into action. Collecting data of your own life can be meaningfull. We can collaborate with no-humans technology, algorythms, nature, and other). There is no limit between designer and \u2018whom you design for\u2019. Talk 3: Sergio Urue\u00f1a \u00b6 I was inspired by responsible innovation and by asking myself \u201cwhat being responsible means?\u201d. The circular approach of understanding how society and technology are mutually shaping reality, make me realize the importance of \u201ctaking care of the future\u201d and also how \u201cthings have agency\u201d. Everything is affected and affects (enacted by and for) everything in a way. Taking in consideration the 4 dimensions (inclusion, reflexivity, responsiveness and anticipation) is a frame for developing projects for the future. Talk 4: Saul Baeza \u00b6 I was inspired by the concept of radical design and going further on our own boundaries. This radicality happens always in a context, so what is radical for me is different than from anybody else. Sometimes to go further, means to go back to the roots (to the basis). The exploration is a thing in itself, do not expect a specific outcome. Good examples of how our body is a tool for exploring and understanding life, society and the world. Talk 4: Ron Wakkary \u00b6 I was inspired by the idea of the gathering of humans and non humans for the intention of designing something. In \u201cdesign with\u201d concept, we are all interconected (relationality) and things have their own agency. How do we co-habit this more than human world? Biographies are made of different biographies. There is a \u201cspeaken subject\u201d that narrates it. When will a biography end?, and what is left behind? Final Reflection \u00b6 Who you are? I am a human being. I am son, grandson, brother, uncle, friend, husband. I am strongly attached to my emotions and aware of what is happening around me. I get inspired by people. I need social interaction to grow, to change, to live. It is difficult to define myself, so it is easy to say that I feel like a multidisciplinary professional: study commercial engineering as undergraduate, study acting and theater, specialize in innovation methodologies, teach in different educational contexts, cofounded a B corp that works with communities, and now expanding my career through design and technology for emergent futures. I have never like tags or job titles but know it is to simplify reality and who we are or what we do. For me it would be: Social entrepreneur, business designer & educator. Interested in design as a tool for social transformation and the generation of positive impact for the future(s). I am passionate about fabrication process (the doing), art as a social agent of expression and food culture. What makes you unique (identity)? The way I built relationships with people. Personal \u201cvision\u201d of your future as a professional Design Researcher and Social Doer. I want to feel as a permanent learner, exploring new things beyond boundaries, constructing alternative presents and imagining emergent futures. I want to continue my radical design journey as a trigger for generating awareness about critical scenarios. I want to continue discovering things, but not in only in a theoretical form but with my feet in the street. Doing what is needed, always with a social sense. I feel responsible for what is happening and also I feel I have the power to make a positive change.","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"seminars/11%20-Future%20Talks/#future-talks","text":"","title":"Future Talks"},{"location":"seminars/11%20-Future%20Talks/#talk-1-audrey-desjardins","text":"I was inspired by the way design interventions are part of daily life (in a first person perspective).

My definition: a wave is the relationship between a specific amount of wind, a portion of the sea, and the location of the moon. In a way, these three things are aligned in a unique form that create what we humans call \u201cwave\u201d. What about other agents we are not aware of that affect the fabrication of this wave? How we find these invisible relations that make the reality possible? To Design means to understand the relationship between humans and non- humans. In this matter, relationality is fundamental when describing the being. Exploring the interconnection between everyone and everything, and discovering hidden forces of ecology can be a trigger for shifting our role in the world. When I say \u201cthings\u201d I mean \u201ceverything and everyone that exists\u201d. Things do not exist without other things around. When changing this context where things emerge, new things appear. This is attached to the biography of each thing. Each biography is a story, and each story has a unique meaning due to a context. A thing is always an interconnected being, we see it or not. When this specific interconnection occurs, reality is created. Senses are the human tools for creating and understanding reality. Each thing (interconnection in a context) is also a message. Messages construct narratives, and these narratives are usually curated by humans thanks to communication. The way we communicate in a traditional present or to \u201chave voice\u201d is primary human centered, and the reality is created from this empowered point of view. What if we give voice to agents that usually do not have it? How to understand life, the world and reality from a \u201cno voice\u201d point of view? An interconnected being has a specific form of message which allows its existence. Redefining the communication concept plays a significant role as a tool for revealing new narratives and by consequence in creating alternative realities. This process can be driven for emergent outcomes. Radical doing is the main characteristic when constructing something that we do not imagine. We do not base in theoretic parameters because that builds walls that are difficult to break. We do not design for someone specific, because we need to allow participation in any form, so the unexpected can appear. This paper explores the role of communication for existence, the emergent relationships between humans and non-humans and the boundaries of the message and the messenger for the appearance of a new being. Design can save the world, with empathy as a core value for relationships that go beyond any imagined scenario. Exploring these hidden relationships and finally revealing that reality has always meant to be a specific form of ordering things in a context, is a must for emergent futures. Design for no one and for nobody, do not take relationships for granted and be brave in rethinking things by changing context, because everything and everyone have something to say, to participate and to be.","title":"Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"seminars/12-Sense%20and%20Meaning/#sense-and-meaning","text":"","title":"Sense and Meaning"},{"location":"seminars/12-Sense%20and%20Meaning/#abstract","text":"What is a wave?
