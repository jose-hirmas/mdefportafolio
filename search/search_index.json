This first weekend was to settle out, go around the city, explore some typical places and be prepared for class. My feelings are anxiety, surprise, and happiness, preparing for new learnings and the MDEF experience. The Best: the city multicultural vibe and food. The Challenges: Explore the city \u201cTodo lo que puede ser imaginado es real\u201d \u00b6 The pre courses where a nice \u201cexcuse\u201d to know my future classmates, with their different backgrounds. Also, a good start for exploring IAAC\u00b4s fab lab and the Poblenou\u2019s neighborhood. I liked the fact of being part of a multicultural and international master, where all the conversations start from empathy and trying to discover the other skills, knowledge and attitudes towards life. During our pre courses there was a lot of new information about technology, electronics design, softwares and the use of machines which I have never been up to, which puts me in a challenge to learn these techniques. The Led Circuit (Inputs and Outputs) With the electronics kit, we had to develop a led project which consisted in a game where you had to chose some letters and the light turned on green or red depending if you where right or wrong. Mama is Here (Communicating Design Ideas) Design a poster for a random idea. My idea was an app that cooked your own local recipes. This app was for immigrants that wanted to remember a special home dish. Agoraphobia (Communicating Design Ideas) Design a reel for a random object, spirit and segment. The spirit was \u201cagoraphobia\u201d, the segment was \u201cresearchers\u201d and the object that we choose was this one: Here is a link with the final reel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOFtGCziHsY The Imperfect Lamp (Fab Lab) design and fabricate a lamp using 3d printers, digital design softwares and laser cutting machines. The Best: \u00b6 Discovering the fab lab machines and our capacity to create almost anything. The Lessons Learned: \u00b6 It is better to make a small project and finished it, than rather being too ambitious and just do a part of it. The time is limited for the design projects. Each classmate has his skills and knowledge which is great when working in multidisciplinary teams. Learning by doing will be one of my central pillars for this master.

For me, traditional education is obsolete in latam and the world. I have been making classes in public rural schools back in Chile, where I have evidence the importance of bonding between students and teacher-student, for their integral formation. Also interested in how learning by doing and gamification can be an excellent tool for children\u00b4s integration. Weak Signals: Emotional Design and Maker Education I believe that emotions are present in every interaction between humans and their environment. Also that the main issues we are facing are because we need to deeply understand what we are feeling and what others also feel. I am really interested in exploring how human emotions can be sustained as a main \u201ccity developer\u201d. We don\u00b4t talk about feelings because we get embarrassed, but we always feel things. The challenge is how we get conscious about our own feelings and emotions, and how we can manage to know new people\u00b4s emotions to understand how body, brain and soul are connected. The learning process is not about theorical and technical skills, but how we can use in the real world all the tools we develop. I like the doing as the best and more effective way to really explore, discover and learn. Since school I have been not a traditional student, I coud not sit in a chair and just listen teachers, always being hyperkinetic and having attention deficit (ADHD) was really a challenge when going to a traditional school and education. Also during my life I have managed to realize that the best way of learning for me was by doing things on my own. The concept of maker is attached to the capacity of creation that we humans are able to. Understanding humans as makers is also seeing us creators, discoverers, imagining new Futures and trying the best ways. Also, to accept that we are not perfect in anyway and that making mistake is not a bad thing, but a way to discover yourself, gain knowledge, and explore the world. Relationship between two weak signals During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. Multiscalar Diagram: The Hike of Emotions During this week I have been exploring myself emotions since I wake up until I go to sleep in the night, being aware of every design experience I had the opportunity to be in. We went on a hiking experience for developing the multiscalar diagram On this adventure I decided to pay attention to my emotions during all day. When getting to the Metro station on time: anxiety and a bit of stress because i as a bit late We started de hike joining all together next to a olive tree which is a safe place for me because this is the tree that represents my family. My emotions: safety and comfort. In the walk we had the opportunity to try some native fruit I don\u2019t remember the name but this brought me to my childhood because we had a lot of fruit trees and go around eating them. This provoke me joy and nostalgia. In one part of the hike we had to get in silence and the atmosphere changed. We enter \u201cthe forest\u201d in a really quite mood. There I felt peace and freedom emotions. Also the climate change and it was colder. \u00bfHow do climate changes make you feel? We get to the top and had an amazing view of almost all Barcelona. For the first time I had a sense of dimensions of the city, seeing everything from a different perspective (\u201clooking from the balcony\u201d). I felt small and humble and, in a way, big enough for trying to solve some cities issues. My emotions were dragged to motivation and empowerment. All the way to the top and going down we were also in a happy and exploring mood. My classmates have a nice attitude, so we can talk and go knowing each other more. For me, it is important the relations that we have early constructed with the group, each one with their own backgrounds, cultures, thoughts, and ways of seeing life. We are in a journey together but living it at our own pace. Some questions and notes I have in different scales: How do surroundings make you feel? Design flavors for generating emotions How can we design a city for positive emotions (happy people)? Nature is a guide for emotional design The city can be transformed into a big playing surface. The sense of community is vital for social development We need to bond education and emotions. Collaborative diagram For the collaborative diagram I was amazed with the education issues and thoughts that some of my classmates have, that are really attached to my own beliefs. This make me think that I all not alone on this quest. I liked the concept of \u201ccross generation\u201d and \u201ca playground for everyone\u201d. I will like to contact: - Go to explore some schools and alternative learning methods in Barcelona - Neuroeducation specialist for understanding how emotions and education are bond. - Participate in maker experience Experiment I will like to make: - Design a workshop for understanding kids emotions when going on an learning experience. A new skill for my personal development plan: - learning to fail and trying to focus. - Unlearning to learn. The best: \u00b6 the amazing view from the top of the mountain. The Lessons Learned: \u00b6 There are many futures. Our classmates are usefull resources. Colaboration is relevant for the development of my project. Technology is constructed in a context. The challenges: \u00b6 Change my mindset to exploration and observation in every day.
