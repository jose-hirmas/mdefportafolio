Te contar\u00e9 una historia\u2026 \u00b6 I am Jose\u0301 Hirmas Stark. Chilean. Social entrepreneur. Business designer. Educator. Grandson of immigrants: Palestinian descent from my father, Hungarian from my mother. Interested in: - the power of human relationships for educational development and justice - designing business projects that generate positive social outcomes - theater and acting as a communicational tool for developing your attitude - good food and craft beer taster The arrival: \u00b6 \u201cCaminante no hay camino, se hace camino al andar\u201d \u00b6 I arrived at Barcelona on Friday 17 Sept 2021, after leaving Chile where I have worked and lived all my life. This first weekend was to settle out, go around the city, explore some typical places and be prepared for class. My feelings are anxiety, surprise, and happiness, preparing for new learnings and the MDEF experience. The Best: the city multicultural vibe and food. The Challenges: Explore the city ![] (mdef-template/docs/images/imageintro.png\u201d) Week 0 - Pre-courses: \u00b6 \u201cTodo lo que puede ser imaginado es real\u201d \u00b6 The pre courses where a nice \u201cexcuse\u201d to know my future classmates, with their different backgrounds. Also, a good start for exploring IAAC\u00b4s fab lab and the Poblenou\u2019s neighborhood. I liked the fact of being part of a multicultural and international master, where all the conversations start from empathy and trying to discover the other skills, knowledge and attitudes towards life. During our pre courses there was a lot of new information about technology, electronics design, softwares and the use of machines which I have never been up to, which puts me in a challenge to learn these techniques. Assignments: The Led Circuit (Inputs and Outputs): With the electronics kit, we had to develop a led project which consisted in a game where you had to chose some letters and the light turned on green or red depending if you where right or wrong. ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenledcircuit.jpg) Mama is Here (Communicating Design Ideas): design a poster for a random idea. My idea was an app that cooked your own local recipes. This app was for immigrants that wanted to remember a special home dish. ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenmamaishere.png) Agoraphobia (Communicating Design Ideas): design a reel for a random object, spirit and segment. The spirit was \u201cagoraphobia\u201d, the segment was \u201cresearchers\u201d and the object that we choose was this one: ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenagoraphobia.jpg) Here is a link with the final reel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOFtGCziHsY The Imperfect Lamp (Fab Lab): design and fabricate a lamp using 3d printers, digital design softwares and laser cutting machines. ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenlamp1.jpg) ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenlamp2.jpg) ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenlamp3.jpg) ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenlamp4.jpg) The Best: Discovering the fab lab machines and our capacity to create almost anything. The Lessons Learned: - It is better to make a small project and finished it, than rather being too ambitious and just do a part of it. The time is limited for the design projects. - Each classmate has his skills and knowledge which is great when working in multidisciplinary teams. - Learning by doing will be one of my central pillars for this master. The Challenges: - Arduino, electronics and coding. - Illustrator and Photoshop software - Rhino and Fusion 360 digital design softwares - Printing in a 3D printer and using laser cutting machine Week 1 \u2013 Bootcamp: \u00b6 \u201cMe gusta la gente sent\u00ed pensante, que no separa la raz\u00f3n del coraz\u00f3n\u201d \u00b6 This first week was a good start to guide and focus on the expectations of the MDEF, understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d and purpose of this experience. During this week I have been thinking a lot in my own interests and my past working experience, trying to plan a future road for my professional career. In my walks around I have been wondering the multicultural city of Barcelona and how all the people enjoy open public spaces. The life happens in parks, public spaces and in the street, where the sense of community is palpable. Assignments What\u00b4s My Fight ![] (/Users/josehirmas/Desktop/MDEF/MDEFwebsite/mdef-template/docs/images/Imagenmyfight.jpg) Human relationships and the learning that is generated when we share moves me. In general I am a social person, who vibrates with the human encounter. Throughout my life I have been a privileged person in social and educational terms, which has made me discover the lack of learning opportunities that exist in some sectors of my city, my country and the world. I have worked in vulnerable contexts to support children and young people, empower them and create bonds so that they can develop their full potential. My fight is about THE POWER OF HUMAN RELATIONS and how this affects the learning process of people. Design vision of how our (social) world could be in the (near) future: My vision is to generate spaces for human relations and their educational and social development, empowering in the need of being part of something, accepting each others realities, empathizing, sharing and creating community as a main concept.

The Lessons Learned: - Be with an introspective attitude towards the development of my project. \u201cIt\u2019s about me\u201d. - The sense community is vital for the development of a social project. - We must go out and meet the people. - First Person Perspective as a design process.

For me, traditional education is obsolete in latam and the world. I have been making classes in public rural schools back in Chile, where I have evidence the importance of bonding between students and teacher-student, for their integral formation. Also interested in how learning by doing and gamification can be an excellent tool for children\u00b4s integration. I believe that emotions are present in every interaction between humans and their environment. Also that the main issues we are facing are because we need to deeply understand what we are feeling and what others also feel. I am really interested in exploring how human emotions can be sustained as a main \u201ccity developer\u201d. We don\u00b4t talk about feelings because we get embarrassed, but we always feel things. The challenge is how we get conscious about our own feelings and emotions, and how we can manage to know new people\u00b4s emotions to understand how body, brain and soul are connected. The learning process is not about theorical and technical skills, but how we can use in the real world all the tools we develop. I like the doing as the best and more effective way to really explore, discover and learn. Since school I have been not a traditional student, I coud not sit in a chair and just listen teachers, always being hyperkinetic and having attention deficit (ADHD) was really a challenge when going to a traditional school and education. Also during my life I have managed to realize that the best way of learning for me was by doing things on my own. The concept of maker is attached to the capacity of creation that we humans are able to. Understanding humans as makers is also seeing us creators, discoverers, imagining new Futures and trying the best ways. Also, to accept that we are not perfect in anyway and that making mistake is not a bad thing, but a way to discover yourself, gain knowledge, and explore the world.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"The weak signals I chose are \u201cEmotional Design\u201d and \u201cMaker Education\u201d, this is because I have interests in the relationship and interactions between human beings and how emotions play a role in the social educational development.
